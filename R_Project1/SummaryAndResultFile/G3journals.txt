Its genome is large (> 10 Gb) and contains over 80% repeated sequences. The successful whole-genome-shotgun assembly of the wild emmer (accession Zavitan) genome sequence (WEW_v1.0) was an important milestone for wheat genomics. In an effort to improve this assembly, an optical map of accession Zavitan was constructed using Bionano Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technology. The map spanned 10.4 Gb. This map and another map produced earlier by us with the Bionanoís Nick Label Repair and Stain (NLRS) technology were used to improve the current wild emmer assembly. The WEW_v1.0 assembly consisted of 151,912 scaffolds. Of them, 3,102 could be confidently aligned on the optical maps. Forty-seven were chimeric. They were disjoined and new scaffolds were assembled with the aid of the optical maps. The total number of scaffolds was reduced from 151,912 to 149,252 and N50 increased from 6.96 Mb to 72.63 Mb. Of the 149,252 scaffolds, 485 scaffolds, which accounted for 97% of the total genome length, were aligned and oriented on genetic maps, and new WEW_v2.0 pseudomolecules were constructed. The new pseudomolecules included 333 scaffolds (68.51 Mb) which were originally unassigned, 226 scaffolds (554.84 Mb) were placed into new locations, and 332 scaffolds (394.83 Mb) were re-oriented. The improved wild emmer genome assembly is an important resource for understanding genomic modification that occurred by domestication."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/619.full.pdf"

These ground-nesting bees defend their developing offspring against pathogens and predators, and thus exhibit some of the key traits that preceded insect sociality. Alkali bees are also efficient native pollinators of alfalfa seed, which is a crop of major economic value in the United States. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated a high-quality draft genome of 299.6 Mbp for this species. Repetitive content makes up more than one-third of this genome, and previously uncharacterized transposable elements are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA. We predicted 10,847 protein coding genes, and identify 479 of these undergoing positive directional selection with the use of population genetic analysis based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 19 individuals. We found evidence of recent population bottlenecks, but no significant evidence of population structure. We also identify 45 genes enriched for protein translation and folding, transcriptional regulation, and triglyceride metabolism evolving slower in alkali bees compared to other halictid bees. These resources will be useful for future studies of bee comparative genomics and pollinator health research."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/625.full.pdf"

Defective stress responses are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Phenol derivatives, naturally occurring and synthetic, display beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The phenol derivatives in this study, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol A (BPA), are widely used as food preservatives and industrial chemicals. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their biological activity and correlation with disease development; understanding the molecular basis of phenol action is a key step for addressing issues relevant to human health. This work presents the first comparative genomic analysis of the genetic networks for phenol stress response in an evolutionary context of two divergent yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomic screening of deletion strain libraries of the two yeasts identified genes required for cellular response to phenol stress, which are enriched in human orthologs. Functional analysis of these genes uncovered the major signaling pathways involved. The results provide a global view of the biological events constituting the defense process, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, phenol detoxification by V-ATPases, reactive oxygen species alleviation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress relief through ergosterol and the unfolded protein response, revealing novel roles for these cellular pathways."

In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization. We generated a random transposon mutant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 comprising 39,500 unique insertions and identified genes required for growth in culture and on corn roots. A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the INSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5- to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport. INSeq technology proved a successful tool to identify fitness factors in P. aeruginosa PGPR2 for root colonization."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/651.full.pdf"

Bayesian genotype calling can mitigate these issues, but previously has only been implemented in software that requires a reference genome or uses priors that may be inappropriate for the population. Here we present several novel Bayesian algorithms that estimate genotype posterior probabilities, all of which are implemented in a new R package, polyRAD. Appropriate priors can be specified for mapping populations, populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or structured populations, and in each case can be informed by genotypes at linked markers. The polyRAD software imports read depth from several existing pipelines, and outputs continuous or discrete numerical genotypes suitable for analyses such as genome-wide association and genomic prediction."

In inbred populations, pairwise epistasis is present as additive by additive interactions. Testing for epistasis presents a multiple testing problem as the pairwise search space for modest numbers of markers is large. Single markers do not necessarily track functional units of interacting chromatin as well as haplotype based methods do. To harness the power of multiple markers while minimizing the number of tests conducted, we present a low resolution test for epistatic interactions across whole chromosome arms. Epistasis covariance matrices were constructed from the additive covariances of individual chromosome arms. These covariances were subsequently used to estimate an epistatic variance parameter while correcting for background additive and epistatic effects. We find significant epistasis for 2% of the interactions tested for four agronomic traits in a winter wheat breeding population. Interactions across homeologous chromosome arms were identified, but were less abundant than other chromosome arm pair interactions. The homeologous chromosome arm pair 4BL/4DL showed a strong negative relationship between additive and interaction effects that may be indicative of functional redundancy. Several chromosome arms appeared to act as hubs in an interaction network, suggesting that they may contain important regulatory factors. The differential patterns of epistasis across different traits demonstrate that detection of epistatic interactions is robust when correcting for background additive and epistatic effects in the population. The low resolution epistasis mapping method presented here identifies important epistatic interactions with a limited number of statistical tests at the cost of low precision."

These events often occur through hybridization between closely related species, resulting in an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. With the availability of affordable genotyping and a reference genome to locate markers, breeders of allopolyploids now have the opportunity to manipulate subgenomes independently. This also presents a unique opportunity to investigate epistatic interactions between homeologous orthologs across subgenomes. We present a statistical framework for partitioning genetic variance to the subgenomes of an allopolyploid, predicting breeding values for each subgenome, and determining the importance of inter-genomic epistasis. We demonstrate using an allohexaploid wheat breeding population evaluated in Ithaca, NY and an important wheat dataset from CIMMYT previously shown to demonstrate non-additive genetic variance. Subgenome covariance matrices were constructed and used to calculate subgenome interaction covariance matrices for variance component estimation and genomic prediction. We propose a method to extract population structure from all subgenomes at once before covariances are calculated to reduce collinearity between subgenome estimates. Variance parameter estimation was shown to be reliable for additive subgenome effects, but was less reliable for subgenome interaction components. Predictive ability was equivalent to current genomic prediction methods. Including only inter-genomic interactions resulted in the same increase in accuracy as modeling all pairwise marker interactions. Thus, we provide a new tool for breeders of allopolyploid crops to characterize the genetic architecture of existing populations, determine breeding goals, and develop new strategies for selection of additive effects and fixation of inter-genomic epistasis."

However, the structure of this phenomenon is still poorly known. PD for urinary albumin (PDUAlb) and creatinine (PDUCrea) was mapped using curated data from two nearly genetically identical F2 mouse (Mus musculus) cohorts (383 male F2 C57BL/6J◊A/J (97 SNP) and 207 male F2 C57BL/6J◊A/J ApoE knockout mice (144 SNP)) and a related mapping cohort (340 male F2 DBA/2J◊C57BL/6J (83 SNP, 8 microsatellites)). PDUAlb was associated with markers in regions of Chr 1 (5-64 megabases (MB); 141-158 MB), 3 (~113 MB), 8 (37-68 MB), 14 (92-117 MB) and 17 (14-24 MB) with several positions and quantitative architectures in common between the two C57BL/6J◊A/J cohorts, most of which had a negative dominant construction. One locus for PDUCrea was detected on Chr 19 (57 MB) in the C57BL/6J◊A/J ApoE-/- cohort. The large number of negative dominant loci for albuminuria dispersion relative to conventional quantitative trait loci suggests that the development of albuminuria may be largely genetically dynamic and that randomization in this development is detrimental."

Knowledge of the location of SVs within a neuron can thus provide valuable clues about the location of neurotransmitter release within a neuron and the downstream neurons to which a given neuron is connected, important information for understanding how neural circuits generate behavior. Here the development and characterization of four conditional tagged SV markers for Drosophila melanogaster is presented. This characterization includes evaluation of conditionality, specificity for SV localization, and sensitivity of detection in diverse neuron subtypes. These four SV markers are genome-edited variants of the synaptic vesicle-specific protein Rab3. They depend on either the B2 or FLP recombinases for conditionality, and incorporate GFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, or FLAG or HA epitope tags, for detection."

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation. Our findings suggest that regulation of insulator function by RNA-binding proteins relies on RNA-mediated interactions."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/749.full.pdf"

Particularly, terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolites, major components of the root-derived oleo-gum-resin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities, thus offering a resource for potential therapeutic lead compounds. However, genes and enzymes for terpenoid and coumarin-type phenylpropanoid metabolism have thus far remained uncharacterized in F. assafoetida. Comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of roots, leaves, stems, and flowers was combined with computational annotation to identify candidate genes with probable roles in terpenoid and coumarin biosynthesis. Gene network analysis showed a high abundance of predicted terpenoid- and phenylpropanoid-metabolic pathway genes in flowers. These findings offer a deeper insight into natural product biosynthesis in F. assafoetida and provide genomic resources for exploiting the medicinal potential of this rare plant."

SMIs also serve as lead compounds for drug discovery. However, discovery of selective SMIs is costly and inefficient. The action of SMIs can be modeled simply by tagging gene products with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) that triggers rapid ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the tagged protein upon exposure of live cells to auxin. To determine if this approach is broadly effective, we AID-tagged over 750 essential proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and observed growth inhibition by low concentrations of auxin in over 66% of cases. Polytopic transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum were efficiently depleted if the AID-tag was exposed to cytoplasmic OsTIR1 ubiquitin ligase. The auxin analog 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) was as potent as auxin on AID-tags, but surprisingly NAA was more potent than auxin at inhibiting target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) function. Auxin also synergized with known SMIs when acting on the same essential protein, indicating that AID-tagged strains can be useful for SMI screening. Auxin synergy, resistance mutations, and cellular assays together suggest the essential GMP/GDP-mannose exchanger in the Golgi complex (Vrg4) as the target of a natural cyclic peptide of unknown function (SDZ 90-215). These findings indicate that AID-tagging can efficiently model the action of SMIs before they are discovered and can facilitate SMI discovery."

To conduct meta-analysis of QTL requires projecting them onto a common genomic framework, either a consensus genetic map or genomic sequence. The latter strategy is pursued here. Of 774 QTL mapped in wheat and wheat relatives found in the literature, 585 (75.6%) were successfully projected onto the Aegilops tauschii pseudomolecules. QTL mapped with SNP markers were more successfully projected (92.2%) than those mapped with SSR markers (66.2%). The QTL were not distributed homogeneously along chromosome arms. Their frequencies increased in the proximal-to-distal direction but declined in the most distal regions and were weakly correlated with recombination rates along the chromosome arms. Databases for projected SSR markers and QTL were constructed and incorporated into the Ae. tauschii JBrowse. To facilitate meta-QTL analysis, eight clusters of QTL were used to estimate standard deviations () of independently mapped QTL projected onto the Ae. tauschii genome sequence. The standard deviations  were modeled as an exponential decay function of recombination rates along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes. We implemented four hypothesis tests for determining the membership of query QTL. The hypothesis tests and estimation procedure for  were implemented in a web portal for meta-analysis of projected QTL. Twenty-one QTL for Fusarium head blight resistance mapped on wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D were analyzed to illustrate the use of the portal for meta-QTL analyses."

The popular SPAdes assembler makes it simple to generate a de novo genome assembly for any yeast species. However, whereas making genome assemblies has become routine, understanding what they contain is still challenging. Here, we show how graphing the information that SPAdes provides about the length and coverage of each scaffold can be used to investigate the nature of an assembly, and to diagnose possible problems. Scaffolds derived from mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal DNA, and yeast plasmids can be identified by their high coverage. Contaminating data, such as cross-contamination from other samples in a multiplex sequencing run, can be identified by its low coverage. Scaffolds derived from the bacteriophage PhiX174 and Lambda DNAs that are frequently used as molecular standards in Illumina protocols can also be detected. Assemblies of yeast genomes with high heterozygosity, such as interspecies hybrids, often contain two types of scaffold: regions of the genome where the two alleles assembled into two separate scaffolds and each has a coverage level C, and regions where the two alleles co-assembled (collapsed) into a single scaffold that has a coverage level 2C. Visualizing the data with Coverage-vs.-Length (CVL) plots, which can be done using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, provides a simple method to understand the structure of a genome assembly and detect aberrant scaffolds or contigs. We provide a Python script that allows assemblies to be filtered to remove contaminants identified in CVL plots."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/879.full.pdf"

However, when all founders are genotyped for a large number of markers, such relationships can be derived for descendants as expected genomic relationships conditional on the observed founder allele frequencies. A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes."

Although mule deer meet many ideal conditions for a molecular ecological research species, such as high abundance, ecological importance, and broad dispersal and gene flow, conservation genetic studies have been limited by a relative lack of existing genomic resources and inherent difficulties caused by introgression with white-tailed deer. Many molecular tools currently available for the study of cervids were designed using reference assemblies of divergent model species, specifically cattle (Bos taurus). Bovidae and Cervidae diverged approximately 28 million years ago, therefore, we sought to ameliorate the available resources by contributing the first mule deer whole genome sequence draft assembly with an average genome-wide read depth of 25X, using the white-tailed genome assembly (Ovir.te_1.0) as a reference. Comparing the two assemblies, we identified ~33 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion variants. We then verified fixed SNP differences between the two species and developed a 40-loci SNP assay capable of identifying pure mule deer, white-tailed deer, and interspecific hybrids. Assignment capacity of the panel, which was tested on simulated datasets, is reliable up to and including the third backcross hybrid generation. Identification of post-F1 hybrids will be necessary for hybrid zone population studies going forward, and the new mule deer assembly will be a valuable resource for genetic and comparative genomics studies."

These runs of homozygosity (ROH) can contribute to inbreeding depression if they contain deleterious variants that are fully or partially recessive. Several lines of evidence have been used to show that long (> 5 megabase) ROH are disproportionately likely to harbor deleterious variation, but the extent to which long vs. short tracts contribute to autozygosity at loci known to be deleterious and recessive has not been studied. In domestic dogs, nearly 200 mutations are known to cause recessive diseases, most of which can be efficiently assayed using SNP arrays. By examining genome-wide data from over 200,000 markers, including 150 recessive disease variants, we built high-resolution ROH density maps for nearly 2,500 dogs, recording ROH down to 500 kilobases. We observed over 678 homozygous deleterious recessive genotypes in the panel across 29 loci, 90% of which overlapped with ROH inferred by GERMLINE. Although most of these genotypes were contained in ROH over 5 Mb in length, 14% were contained in short (0.5 - 2.5 megabase) tracts, a significant enrichment compared to the genetic background, suggesting that even short tracts are useful for computing inbreeding metrics like the coefficient of inbreeding estimated from ROH (FROH). In our dataset, FROH differed significantly both within and among dog breeds. All breeds harbored some regions of reduced genetic diversity due to drift or selective sweeps, but the degree of inbreeding and the proportion of inbreeding caused by short vs. long tracts differed between breeds, reflecting their different population histories. Although only available for a few species, large genome-wide datasets including recessive disease variants hold particular promise not only for disentangling the genetic architecture of inbreeding depression, but also evaluating and improving upon current approaches for detecting ROH."

C. glabrata displays high resistance to common azole antifungals, which necessitates new treatments. In this investigation, we identified five C. glabrata deletion mutants (<U+2206>ada2, <U+2206>bas1, <U+2206>hir3, <U+2206>ino2 and <U+2206>met31) from a library of 196 transcription factor mutants that were unable to grow and activate an immune response in Drosophila larvae. This highlighted the importance of these transcription factors in C. glabrata infectivity. Further ex vivo investigation into these mutants revealed the requirement of C. glabrata ADA2 for oxidative stress tolerance. We confirmed this observation in vivo whereby growth of the C. glabrata <U+0394>ada2 strain was permitted only in flies with suppressed production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, overexpression of ADA2 promoted C. glabrata replication in infected wild type larvae resulting in larval killing. We propose that ADA2 orchestrates the response of C. glabrata against ROS-mediated immune defenses during infection. With the need to find alternative antifungal treatment for C. glabrata infections, genes required for survival in the host environment, such as ADA2, provide promising potential targets."

They regulate homeostasis and signaling during development, stem cell proliferation, metabolism, cancer, wound responses, and aging, displaying intriguing molecular and functional conservation with vertebrate macrophages. Given the relative ease of genetics in Drosophila compared to vertebrates, tools permitting visualization and genetic manipulation of plasmatocytes and surrounding tissues independently at all stages would greatly aid a fuller understanding of these processes, but are lacking. Here, we describe a comprehensive set of transgenic lines that allow this. These include extremely brightly fluorescing mCherry-based lines that allow GAL4-independent visualization of plasmatocyte nuclei, the cytoplasm, or the actin cytoskeleton from embryonic stage 8 through adulthood in both live and fixed samples even as heterozygotes, greatly facilitating screening. These lines allow live visualization and tracking of embryonic plasmatocytes, as well as larval plasmatocytes residing at the body wall or flowing with the surrounding hemolymph. With confocal imaging, interactions of plasmatocytes and inner tissues can be seen in live or fixed embryos, larvae, and adults. They permit efficient GAL4-independent Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis/sorting of plasmatocytes throughout life. To facilitate genetic studies of reciprocal signaling, we have also made a plasmatocyte-expressing QF2 line that, in combination with extant GAL4 drivers, allows independent genetic manipulation of both plasmatocytes and surrounding tissues, and GAL80 lines that block GAL4 drivers from affecting plasmatocytes, all of which function from the early embryo to the adult."

The major histocompatibility complex class I Dk molecule is one such determinant that controls MCMV through the action of natural killer (NK) cells. However, the extent of NK cellñmediated Dk-dependent resistance to infection varies in different mouse strains. The molecular genetic basis of this variation remains unclear. Previous work to examine the Dk effect on MCMV resistance in MA/My ◊ C57L offspring discovered multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) that may serve to modify NK cells or their capacity to respond during MCMV infection. One QTL in particular, Cmv5, was found to regulate the frequency of NK cells and secondary lymphoid organ structure in spleen during MCMV infection. Cmv5 alleles, however, have not been identified. We therefore sequenced and analyzed genome-wide exome (GWE) variants, including those aligned to the critical genetic interval, in Cmv5-disparate mouse strains. Their GWE variant profiles were compared to assess strain-specific sequence data integrity and to analyze mouse strain relatedness across the genome. GWE content was further compared against data from the Mouse Genomes Project. This approach was developed as a platform for using GWE variants to define genomic regions of divergence and similarity in different mouse strains while also validating the overall quality of GWE sequence data. Moreover, the analysis provides a framework for the selection of novel QTL candidate sequences, including at the Cmv5 critical region."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/7/6/1979.full.pdf"

The majority of known resistance genes are already ineffective against current races of Pst, necessitating the identification and introgression of new sources of resistance. Germplasm core collections that reflect the range of genetic and phenotypic diversity of crop species are ideal platforms for examining the genetic architecture of complex traits such as resistance to stripe rust. We report the results of genetic characterization and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) for resistance to stripe rust in a core subset of 1175 accessions in the National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) winter wheat germplasm collection, based on genotyping with the wheat 9K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) iSelect assay and phenotyping of seedling and adult plants under natural disease epidemics in four environments. High correlations among the field data translated into high heritability values within and across locations. Population structure was evident when accessions were grouped by stripe rust reaction. GWAS identified 127 resistance loci that were effective across at least two environments, including 20 with significant genome-wide adjusted P-values. Based on relative map positions of previously reported genes and QTL, five of the QTL with significant genome-wide adjusted P-values in this study represent potentially new loci. This study provides an overview of the diversity of Pst resistance in the NSGC winter wheat germplasm core collection, which can be exploited for diversification of stripe rust resistance in breeding programs."

Six hundred sixty seven Han Chinese patients with AITDs were selected as study subjects, including 417 patients with Gravesí disease (GD), 250 patients with Hashimotoís thyroiditis (HT) and 301 healthy control patients. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and the mass spectrometry technique were used to genotype five CLEC16A single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12708716, rs12917716, rs12931878, rs2903692, and rs6498169). Higher frequency of G allele of rs6498169 CLEC16A gene in AITDs patients [P = 0.029, odds ratio (OR) 1.29 and 95% confidence interval 1.022-1.505] was observed. In addition an association between rs6498169 and HT was observed with statistical significance (P = 0.018, OR 1.335, 95% confidence interval 1.051-1.696). Furthermore, the GG haplotype containing the major allele of (rs12708716 and rs6498169) was associated with an increased risk of HT (P = 0.0148, OR 1.344). When patients with HT and controls were compared, results from the dominant and recessive models showed that the genotype frequency of rs6498169 were at borderline levels (P = 0.054 and P = 0.05), and the other four SNPs of CLEC16A gene showed no significant association with AITDs. Our results suggest that polymorphisms rs6498169 of CLEC16A gene confers susceptibility to AITDs. We therefore disclose for the first time the association of rs6498169 SNP with AITDs."

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes."

Here we use RNA-seq to de novo assemble a transcriptome and identify genes differentially expressed in young gametophytes as their sex is determined by the presence or absence of the male-inducing pheromone called antheridiogen. Of the 1,163 consensus differentially expressed genes identified, the vast majority (1,030) are up-regulated in gametophytes treated with antheridiogen. GO term enrichment analyses of these DEGs reveals that a large number of genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming of the gametophyte genome are up-regulated by the pheromone. Additional hormone response and development genes are also up-regulated by the pheromone. This C. richardii gametophyte transcriptome and gene expression dataset will prove useful for studies focusing on sex determination and differentiation in plants."

This includes the mechanisms of coping with a duplicated sex determination system and whether this has an impact on increasing the diversity of sex determination mechanisms. Other impacts include sexual conflict, where alleles having different optimums in each sex can result in sequestration of genes into nonrecombining sex chromosomes. Sex chromosome development itself may involve sex-specific recombination rate (i.e., heterochiasmy), which is also poorly understood. The family Salmonidae is a model system for these phenomena, having undergone autotetraploidization and subsequent rediploidization in most of the genome at the base of the lineage. The salmonid master sex determining gene is known, and many species have nonhomologous sex chromosomes, putatively due to transposition of this gene. In this study, we identify the sex chromosome of Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis and compare sex chromosome identities across the lineage (eight species and four genera). Although nonhomology is frequent, homologous sex chromosomes and other consistencies are present in distantly related species, indicating probable convergence on specific sex and neo-sex chromosomes. We also characterize strong heterochiasmy with 2.7-fold more crossovers in maternal than paternal haplotypes with paternal crossovers biased to chromosome ends. When considering only rediploidized chromosomes, the overall heterochiasmy trend remains, although with only 1.9-fold more recombination in the female than the male. Y chromosome crossovers are restricted to a single end of the chromosome, and this chromosome contains a large interspecific inversion, although its status between males and females remains unknown. Finally, we identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 21 unique growth, reproductive, and stress-related phenotypes to improve knowledge of the genetic architecture of these traits important to aquaculture and evolution."

Ectomycorrhizal fungi, however, pose a challenge for the study of reproductive biology because most cannot be mated under laboratory conditions. To overcome this barrier, we sequenced the draft genomes of the ectomycorrhizal sister species Rhizopogon vinicolor Smith and Zeller and R. vesiculosus Smith and Zeller (Basidiomycota, Boletales)óthe first genomes available for Basidiomycota trufflesóand characterized gene content and organization surrounding their mating type loci. Both species possess a pair of homeodomain transcription factor homologs at the mating type A-locus as well as pheromone receptor and pheromone precursor homologs at the mating type B-locus. Comparison of Rhizopogon genomes with genomes from Boletales, Agaricales, and Polyporales revealed synteny of the A-locus region within Boletales, but several genomic rearrangements across orders. Our findings suggest correlation between gene content at the B-locus region and breeding system in Boletales with tetrapolar species possessing more diverse gene content than bipolar species. Rhizopogon vinicolor possesses a greater number of B-locus pheromone receptor and precursor genes than R. vesiculosus, as well as a pair of isoprenyl cysteine methyltransferase genes flanking the B-locus compared to a single copy in R. vesiculosus. Examination of dikaryotic single nucleotide polymorphisms within genomes revealed greater heterozygosity in R. vinicolor, consistent with increased rates of outcrossing. Both species possess the components of a heterothallic breeding system with R. vinicolor possessing a B-locus region structure consistent with tetrapolar Boletales and R. vesiculosus possessing a B-locus region structure intermediate between bipolar and tetrapolar Boletales."

They differ in sexual mode, with C. nigoni retaining the ancestral XO maleñXX female outcrossing system, while C. briggsae recently evolved self-fertility and an XX-biased sex ratio. Wild-type C. briggsae and C. nigoni can produce fertile hybrid XX female progeny, but XO progeny are either 100% inviable (when C. briggsae is the mother) or viable but sterile (when C. nigoni is the mother). A recent study provided evidence suggesting that loss of the Cbr-him-8 meiotic regulator in C. briggsae hermaphrodites allowed them to produce viable and fertile hybrid XO male progeny when mated to C. nigoni. Because such males would be useful for a variety of genetic experiments, we sought to verify this result. Preliminary crosses with wild-type C. briggsae hermaphrodites occasionally produced fertile males, but they could not be confirmed to be interspecies hybrids. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) protocol that eliminates any possibility of self-progeny in Cbr-him-8 hermaphrodites, we found sterile males bearing the C. nigoni X chromosome, but no fertile males bearing the C. briggsae X, as in wild-type crosses. Our results suggest that the apparent rescue of XO hybrid viability and fertility is due to incomplete purging of self-sperm prior to mating."

However, still lacking are better statistical models for ordinal phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the selection of candidate genotypes. For this reason, in this paper we explore the genomic based prediction performance of two popular machine learning methods: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) methods vs. the Bayesian threshold genomic best linear unbiased prediction (TGBLUP) model. We used the percentage of cases correctly classified (PCCC) as a metric to measure the prediction performance, and seven real data sets to evaluate the prediction accuracy, and found that the best predictions (in four out of the seven data sets) in terms of PCCC occurred under the TGLBUP model, while the worst occurred under the SVM method. Also, in general we found no statistical differences between using 1, 2 and 3 layers under the MLP models, which means that many times the conventional neuronal network model with only one layer is enough.

Several factors affecting prediction accuracy should be well understood if breeders are to harness genomic selection to its full potential. We used a panel of 10,375 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines genotyped with 18,101 SNP markers to investigate the effect and interaction of training set size, population structure and marker density on genomic prediction accuracy. Through assessing the effect of training set size we showed the rate at which prediction accuracy increases is slower beyond approximately 2,000 lines. The structure of the panel was assessed via principal component analysis and K-means clustering, and its effect on prediction accuracy was examined through a novel cross-validation analysis according to the K-means clusters and breeding cohorts. Here we showed that accuracy can be improved by increasing the diversity within the training set, particularly when relatedness between training and validation sets is low. The breeding cohort analysis revealed that traits with higher selection pressure (lower allelic diversity) can be more accurately predicted by including several previous cohorts in the training set. The effect of marker density and its interaction with population structure was assessed for marker subsets containing between 100 and 17,181 markers. This analysis showed that response to increased marker density is largest when using a diverse training set to predict between poorly related material. These findings represent a significant resource for plant breeders and contribute to the collective knowledge on the optimal structure of calibration panels for genomic prediction."

In this paper, we propose a formal method under the Bayesian decision theory framework to tackle the selection problem based on genomic selection (GS) in single- and multi-trait settings. We proposed and tested three univariate loss functions (Kullback-Leibler, KL; Continuous Ranked Probability Score, CRPS; Linear-Linear loss, LinLin) and their corresponding multivariate generalizations (Kullback-Leibler, KL; Energy Score, EnergyS; and the Multivariate Asymmetric Loss Function, MALF). We derived and expressed all the loss functions in terms of heritability and tested them on a real wheat dataset for one cycle of selection and in a simulated selection program. The performance of each univariate loss function was compared with the standard method of selection (Std) that does not use loss functions. We compared the performance in terms of the selection response and the decrease in the populationís genetic variance during recurrent breeding cycles.Results:suggest that it is possible to obtain better performance in a long-term breeding program using the single-trait scheme by selecting 30% of the best individuals in each cycle but not by selecting 10% of the best individuals. For the multi-trait approach, results show that the population mean for all traits under consideration had positive gains, even though two of the traits were negatively correlated. The corresponding population variances were not statistically different from the different loss function during the 10th selection cycle. Using the loss function should be a useful criterion when selecting the candidates for selection for the next breeding cycle."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/8/9/3019.full.pdf"

Several models have been created to understand this phenomenon and explore it. In the genomic era, several models were employed to improve selection by using markers and account for GE interaction simultaneously. Some of these models use special genetic covariance matrices. In addition, the scale of multi-environment trials is getting larger, and this increases the computational challenges. In this context, we propose an R package that, in general, allows building GE genomic covariance matrices and fitting linear mixed models, in particular, to a few genomic GE models. Here we propose two functions: one to prepare the genomic kernels accounting for the genomic GE and another to perform genomic prediction using a Bayesian linear mixed model. A specific treatment is given for sparse covariance matrices, in particular, to block diagonal matrices that are present in some GE models in order to decrease the computational demand. In empirical comparisons with Bayesian Genomic Linear Regression (BGLR), accuracies and the mean squared error were similar; however, the computational time was up to five times lower than when using the classic approach. Bayesian Genomic Genotype ◊ Environment Interaction (BGGE) is a fast, efficient option for creating genomic GE kernels and making genomic predictions."

Yield gains similar to those achieved in agricultural crops over millennia could be made in forestry species with the use of genomic methods in a much shorter time frame. Here we compare various methods of genomic prediction for eight traits related to foliar terpene yield in Eucalyptus polybractea, a tree grown predominantly for the production of Eucalyptus oil. The genomic markers used in this study are derived from shallow whole genome sequencing of a population of 480 trees. We compare the traditional pedigree-based additive best linear unbiased predictors (ABLUP), genomic BLUP (GBLUP), BayesB genomic prediction model, and a form of GBLUP based on weighting markers according to their influence on traits (BLUP|GA). Predictive ability is assessed under varying marker densities of 10,000, 100,000 and 500,000 SNPs. Our results show that BayesB and BLUP|GA perform best across the eight traits. Predictive ability was higher for individual terpene traits, such as foliar a-pinene and 1,8-cineole concentration (0.59 and 0.73, respectively), than aggregate traits such as total foliar oil concentration (0.38). This is likely a function of the trait architecture and markers used. BLUP|GA was the best model for the two biomass related traits, height and 1 year change in height (0.25 and 0.19, respectively). Predictive ability increased with marker density for most traits, but with diminishing returns. The results of this study are a solid foundation for yield improvement of essential oil producing eucalypts. New markets such as biopolymers and terpene-derived biofuels could benefit from rapid yield increases in undomesticated oil-producing species."

The use of predicted phenotypes to make selections is an active area of research. Here, we evaluate GP for predicting grain yield and compare genomic and phenotypic selection by tracking lines advanced. We examined four independent nurseries of F3:6 and F3:7 lines trialed at 6 to 10 locations each year. Yield was analyzed using mixed models that accounted for experimental design and spatial variations. Genotype-by-sequencing provided nearly 27,000 high-quality SNPs. Average genomic predictive ability, estimated for each year by randomly masking lines as missing in steps of 10% from 10 to 90%, and using the remaining lines from the same year as well as lines from other years in a training set, ranged from 0.23 to 0.55. The predictive ability estimated for a new year using the other years ranged from 0.17 to 0.28. Further, we tracked lines advanced based on phenotype from each of the four F3:6 nurseries. Lines with both above average genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) and phenotypic value (BLUP) were retained for more years compared to lines with either above average GEBV or BLUP alone. The number of lines selected for advancement was substantially greater when predictions were made with 50% of the lines from the testing year added to the training set. Hence, evaluation of only 50% of the lines yearly seems possible. This study provides insights to assess and integrate genomic selection in breeding programs of autogamous crops."

Given a point estimate of variance components, the popular methods SNP-BLUP and GBLUP result in joint estimates of the effect of all markers on the analyzed trait; single and multiple marker frequentist tests (EMMAX) can be constructed from these estimates. Indeed, BLUP methods can be seen simultaneously as Bayesian or frequentist methods. So far there is no formal method to produce Bayesian statistics from GBLUP. Here we show that the Bayes Factor, a commonly admitted statistical procedure, can be computed as the ratio of two normal densities: the first, of the estimate of the marker effect over its posterior standard deviation; the second of the null hypothesis (a value of 0 over the prior standard deviation). We extend the BF to pool evidence from several markers and of several traits. A real data set that we analyze, with ours and existing methods, analyzes 630 horses genotyped for 41711 polymorphic SNPs for the trait ìoutcome of the qualification testî (which addresses gait, or ambling, of horses) for which a known major gene exists. In the horse data, single marker EMMAX shows a significant effect at the right place at Bonferroni level. The BF points to the same location although with low numerical values. The strength of evidence combining information from several consecutive markers increases using the BF and decreases using EMMAX, which comes from a fundamental difference in the Bayesian and frequentist schools of hypothesis testing. We conclude that our BF method complements frequentist EMMAX analyses because it provides a better pooling of evidence across markers, although its use for primary detection is unclear due to the lack of defined rejection thresholds."

Mostly they rely on marker-based information, but scenarios have been reported in which models capitalizing on closely-linked markers that were combined into haplotypes outperformed marker-based models. Detailed comparisons were undertaken to reveal under which circumstances haplotype-based genome-wide prediction models are superior to marker-based models. Specifically, it was of interest to analyze whether and how haplotype-based models may take local epistatic effects between markers into account. Assuming that populations consisted of fully homozygous individuals, a marker-based model in which local epistatic effects inside haplotype blocks were exploited (LEGBLUP) was linearly transformable into a haplotype-based model (HGBLUP). This theoretical derivation formally revealed that haplotype-based genome-wide prediction models capitalize on local epistatic effects among markers. Simulation studies corroborated this finding. Due to its computational efficiency the HGBLUP model promises to be an interesting tool for studies in which ultra-high-density SNP data sets are studied. Applying the HGBLUP model to empirical data sets revealed higher prediction accuracies than for marker-based models for both traits studied using a mouse panel. In contrast, only a small subset of the traits analyzed in crop populations showed such a benefit. Cases in which higher prediction accuracies are observed for HGBLUP than for marker-based models are expected to be of immediate relevance for breeders, due to the tight linkage a beneficial haplotype will be preserved for many generations. In this respect the inheritance of local epistatic effects very much resembles the one of additive effects."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/8/5/1687.full.pdf"

However, there has not been a study to evaluate GS prediction models that may be used for predicting cotton breeding lines across multiple environments. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Bayes Ridge Regression, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces regression models. We then extended the single-site GS model to accommodate genotype ◊ environment interaction (G◊E) in order to assess the merits of multi- over single-environment models in a practical breeding and selection context in cotton, a crop for which this has not previously been evaluated. Our study was based on a population of 215 upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) breeding lines which were evaluated for fiber length and strength at multiple locations in Australia and genotyped with 13,330 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers. BayesB, which assumes unique variance for each marker and a proportion of markers to have large effects, while most other markers have zero effect, was the preferred model. GS accuracy for fiber length based on a single-site model varied across sites, ranging from 0.27 to 0.77 (mean = 0.38), while that of fiber strength ranged from 0.19 to 0.58 (mean = 0.35) using randomly selected sub-populations as the training population. Prediction accuracies from the M◊E model were higher than those for single-site and across-site models, with an average accuracy of 0.71 and 0.59 for fiber length and strength, respectively. The use of the M◊E model could therefore identify which breeding lines have effects that are stable across environments and which ones are responsible for G◊E and so reduce the amount of phenotypic screening required in cotton breeding programs to identify adaptable genotypes."

In the case of quantitative traits, it is common to assume that the distribution of the response variable can be approximated by a normal distribution. However, it is known that the selection process leads to skewed distributions. There is vast statistical literature on skewed distributions, but the skew normal distribution is of particular interest in this research. This distribution includes a third parameter that drives the skewness, so that it generalizes the normal distribution. We propose an extension of the Bayesian whole-genome regression to skew normal distribution data in the context of GS applications, where usually the number of predictors vastly exceeds the sample size. However, it can also be applied when the number of predictors is smaller than the sample size. We used a stochastic representation of a skew normal random variable, which allows the implementation of standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to efficiently fit the proposed model. The predictive ability and goodness of fit of the proposed model were evaluated using simulated and real data, and the results were compared to those obtained by the Bayesian Ridge Regression model.Results:indicate that the proposed model has a better fit and is as good as the conventional Bayesian Ridge Regression model for prediction, based on the DIC criterion and cross-validation, respectively. A computing program coded in the R statistical package and C programming language to fit the proposed model is available as supplementary material."

Treatments can be expensive and environmentally damaging, hence the need for alternative strategies. Breeding for disease resistance can contribute to prevention and control of AGD, providing long-term cumulative benefits in selected stocks. The use of genomic selection can expedite selection for disease resistance due to improved accuracy compared to pedigree-based approaches. The aim of this work was to quantify and characterize genetic variation in AGD resistance in salmon, the genetic architecture of the trait, and the potential of genomic selection to contribute to disease control. An AGD challenge was performed in ~1,500 Atlantic salmon, using gill damage and amoebic load as indicator traits for host resistance. Both traits are heritable (h2 ~0.25-0.30) and show high positive correlation, indicating they may be good measurements of host resistance to AGD. While the genetic architecture of resistance appeared to be largely polygenic in nature, two regions on chromosome 18 showed suggestive association with both AGD resistance traits. Using a cross-validation approach, genomic prediction accuracy was up to 18% higher than that obtained using pedigree, and a reduction in marker density to ~2,000 SNPs was sufficient to obtain accuracies similar to those obtained using the whole dataset. This study indicates that resistance to AGD is a suitable trait for genomic selection, and the addition of this trait to Atlantic salmon breeding programs can lead to more resistant stocks."

With the objective of further modeling the genetic residual of the lines, we incorporated the random intercepts of the lines (l) and generated another three models. Each of these 6 models were fitted with a linear kernel method (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor, GB) and a Gaussian Kernel (GK) method. We compared these 12 model-method combinations with another two multi-environment G◊E interactions models with unstructured variance-covariances (MUC) using GB and GK kernels (4 model-method). Thus, we compared the genomic-enabled prediction accuracy of a total of 16 model-method combinations on two maize data sets with positive phenotypic correlations among environments, and on two wheat data sets with complex G◊E that includes some negative and close to zero phenotypic correlations among environments. The two models (MDs and MDE with the random intercept of the lines and the GK method) were computationally efficient and gave high prediction accuracy in the two maize data sets. Regarding the more complex G◊E wheat data sets, the prediction accuracy of the model-method combination with G◊E, MDs and MDe, including the random intercepts of the lines with GK method had important savings in computing time as compared with the G◊E interaction multi-environment models with unstructured variance-covariances but with lower genomic prediction accuracy."

We conducted studies in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in order to understand the pattern of this competition. Taking into account the competitive ability of genotypes while selecting parents for breeding advancement or commercialization can be very useful. We assumed that competition could occur at two levels: (i) the genotypic level, which we call interclonal, and (ii) the plot level irrespective of the type of genotype, which we call interplot competition or competition error. Modification in incidence matrices was applied in order to relate neighboring genotype/plot to the performance of a target genotype/plot with respect to its competitive ability. This was added into a genomic selection (GS) model to simultaneously predict the direct and competitive ability of a genotype. Predictability of the models was tested through a 10-fold cross-validation method repeated five times. The best model was chosen as the one with the lowest prediction root mean squared error (pRMSE) compared to that of the base model having no competitive component.Results:from our real data studies indicated that <10% increase in accuracy was achieved with GS-interclonal competition model, but this value reached up to 25% with a GS-competition error model. We also found that the competitive influence of a cassava clone is not just limited to the adjacent neighbors but spreads beyond them. Through simulations, we found that a 26% increase of accuracy in estimating trait genotypic effect can be achieved even in the presence of high competitive variance."

We used an exploratory approach using the parametric spatial kernels Power, Spherical, and Gaussian to determine the best kernel for a given scenario. The spatial kernel was fit simultaneously with a genomic kernel in a genomic selection model. Predictability of these models was tested through a 10-fold cross-validation method repeated five times.

Relying on phenotypes and genotypes of a reference population, GS allows performance prediction for young individuals having only genotypes. This is expected to achieve fast high genetic gain but with a potential loss of genetic diversity. Existing methods to conserve genetic diversity depend mostly on the choice of the breeding individuals. In this study, we propose a modification of the reference population composition to mitigate diversity loss. Since the high cost of phenotyping is the limiting factor for GS, our findings are of major economic interest. This study aims to answer the following questions: how would decisions on the reference population affect the breeding population, and how to best select individuals to update the reference population and balance maximizing genetic gain and minimizing loss of genetic diversity? We investigated three updating strategies for the reference population: random, truncation, and optimal contribution (OC) strategies. OC maximizes genetic merit for a fixed loss of genetic diversity. A French MontbÈliarde dairy cattle population with 50K SNP chip genotypes and simulations over 10 generations were used to compare these different strategies using milk production as the trait of interest. Candidates were selected to update the reference population. Prediction bias and both genetic merit and diversity were measured. Changes in the reference population composition slightly affected the breeding population. Optimal contribution strategy appeared to be an acceptable compromise to maintain both genetic gain and diversity in the reference and the breeding populations."

In current genomic selection, although researchers have a large amount of information and appropriate statistical models to process it, there is still limited computing efficiency to do so. Although some statistical models are usually mathematically elegant, many of them are also computationally inefficient, and they are impractical for many traits, lines, environments, and years because they need to sample from huge normal multivariate distributions. For these reasons, this study explores two recommender systems: item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) and the matrix factorization algorithm (MF) in the context of multiple traits and multiple environments. The IBCF and MF methods were compared with two conventional methods on simulated and real data.Results:of the simulated and real data sets show that the IBCF technique was slightly better in terms of prediction accuracy than the two conventional methods and the MF method when the correlation was moderately high. The IBCF technique is very attractive because it produces good predictions when there is high correlation between items (environmentñtrait combinations) and its implementation is computationally feasible, which can be useful for plant breeders who deal with very large data sets."

When only markers were in the panel, the 4 models had accuracies of 80.4%. In panels that included QTL, fitting  in the model improved accuracy, but had little impact when the panel contained only markers.

However, the computational cost of implementing Bayesian models is high, and becomes almost impossible when the number of genotypes, environments, and traits is very large, while, in non-Bayesian models, there are often important and unsolved convergence problems. The variational Bayes method is popular in machine learning, and, by approximating the probability distributions through optimization, it tends to be faster than Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a new genomic variational Bayes version of the Bayesian genomic model with G◊E using half-t priors on each standard deviation (SD) term to guarantee highly noninformative and posterior inferences that are not sensitive to the choice of hyper-parameters. We show the complete theoretical derivation of the full conditional and the variational posterior distributions, and their implementations. We used eight experimental genomic maize and wheat data sets to illustrate the new proposed variational Bayes approximation, and compared its predictions and implementation time with a standard Bayesian genomic model with G◊E.Results:indicated that prediction accuracies are slightly higher in the standard Bayesian model with G◊E than in its variational counterpart, but, in terms of computation time, the variational Bayes genomic model with G◊E is, in general, 10 times faster than the conventional Bayesian genomic model with G◊E. For this reason, the proposed model may be a useful tool for researchers who need to predict and select genotypes in several environments."

The Brazilian beef feedlot industry has grown considerably in the last decade, so the selection of animals with higher growth rates on feedlot has become quite important. Genomic selection (GS) could be used to reduce generation intervals and improve the rate of genetic gains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prediction of genomic-estimated breeding values (GEBV) for average daily weight gain (ADG) in 718 feedlot-finished Nelore steers. Analyses of three Bayesian model specifications [Bayesian GBLUP (BGBLUP), BayesA, and BayesCp] were performed with four genotype panels [Illumina BovineHD BeadChip, TagSNPs, and GeneSeek High- and Low-density indicus (HDi and LDi, respectively)]. Estimates of Pearson correlations, regression coefficients, and mean squared errors were used to assess accuracy and bias of predictions. Overall, the BayesCp model resulted in less biased predictions. Accuracies ranged from 0.18 to 0.27, which are reasonable values given the heritability estimates (from 0.40 to 0.44) and sample size (568 animals in the training population). Furthermore, results from Bos taurus indicus panels were as informative as those from Illumina BovineHD, indicating that they could be used to implement GS at lower costs."

Each of these four models were fitted using two kernel methods: a linear kernel Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor, GBLUP (GB), and a nonlinear kernel Gaussian kernel (GK). The eight model-method combinations were applied to two extensive Brazilian maize data sets (HEL and USP data sets), having different numbers of maize hybrids evaluated in different environments for grain yield (GY), plant height (PH), and ear height (EH).Results:show that the MDe and the MDs models fitted with the Gaussian kernel (MDe-GK, and MDs-GK) had the highest prediction accuracy. For GY in the HEL data set, the increase in prediction accuracy of SM-GK over SM-GB ranged from 9 to 32%.

Over breeding cycles, the requisite linkage disequilibrium (LD) between quantitative trait loci and markers is expected to change as a result of recombination, selection, and drift, leading to a decay in prediction accuracy. Previous research has identified the need to update the training population using data that may capture new LD generated over breeding cycles; however, optimal methods of updating have not been explored. In a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) breeding simulation experiment, we examined prediction accuracy and response to selection when updating the training population each cycle with the best predicted lines, the worst predicted lines, both the best and worst predicted lines, random lines, criterion-selected lines, or no lines. In the short term, we found that updating with the best predicted lines or the best and worst predicted lines resulted in high prediction accuracy and genetic gain, but in the long term, all methods (besides not updating) performed similarly. We also examined the impact of including all data in the training population or only the most recent data. Though patterns among update methods were similar, using a smaller but more recent training population provided a slight advantage in prediction accuracy and genetic gain. In an actual breeding program, a breeder might desire to gather phenotypic data on lines predicted to be the best, perhaps to evaluate possible cultivars. Therefore, our results suggest that an optimal method of updating the training population is also very practical."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/7/5/1499.full.pdf"

Prediction models with genomic and pedigree information included main effects and interaction with environments. Two random CV schemes were applied to predict a subset of lines that were not observed in any of the 18 environments (CV1), and a subset of lines that were not observed in a set of the environments, but were observed in other environments (CV2). Genomic prediction models, including genotype ◊ environment (G◊E) interaction, had the highest average prediction ability under the CV1 scenario for GY (0.31), GN (0.32), GW (0.45), and TTF (0.27).

Plummeting costs of next-generation sequencing and genotyping is revolutionizing the way in which researchers and breeders interface with plant germplasm collections. An example of this is the high density genotyping of the entire USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We assessed the usefulness of 50K single nucleotide polymorphism data collected on 18,480 domesticated soybean (Glycine max) accessions and vast historical phenotypic data for developing genomic prediction models for protein, oil, and yield. Resulting genomic prediction models explained an appreciable amount of the variation in accession performance in independent validation trials, with correlations between predicted and observed reaching up to 0.92 for oil and protein and 0.79 for yield. The optimization of training set design was explored using a series of cross-validation schemes. It was found that the target population and environment need to be well represented in the training set. Second, genomic prediction training sets appear to be robust to the presence of data from diverse geographical locations and genetic clusters. This finding, however, depends on the influence of shattering and lodging, and may be specific to soybean with its presence of maturity groups. The distribution of 7608 nonphenotyped accessions was examined through the application of genomic prediction models. The distribution of predictions of phenotyped accessions was representative of the distribution of predictions for nonphenotyped accessions, with no nonphenotyped accessions being predicted to fall far outside the range of predictions of phenotyped accessions."

Analyses accounting and not accounting for population structure were performed. Genomic prediction models include genotype†◊†environment interaction (G†◊†E). Two alternative prediction strategies were studied: (1) random cross-validation of the data in 20% training (TRN) and 80% testing (TST) (TRN20-TST80) sets, and (2) two types of core sets, ìdiversityî and ìpredictionî, including 10% and 20%, respectively, of the total collections. Accounting for population structure decreased prediction accuracy by 15ñ20% as compared to prediction accuracy obtained when not accounting for population structure. Accounting for population structure gave prediction accuracies for traits evaluated in one environment for TRN20-TST80 that ranged from 0.407 to 0.677 for Mexican landraces, and from 0.166 to 0.662 for Iranian landraces. Prediction accuracy of the 20% diversity core set was similar to accuracies obtained for TRN20-TST80, ranging from 0.412 to 0.654 for Mexican landraces, and from 0.182 to 0.647 for Iranian landraces. The predictive core set gave similar prediction accuracy as the diversity core set for Mexican collections, but slightly lower for Iranian collections. Prediction accuracy when incorporating G†◊†E for DTH and DTM for Mexican landraces for TRN20-TST80 was around 0.60, which is greater than without the G†◊†E term. For Iranian landraces, accuracies were 0.55 for the G†◊†E model with TRN20-TST80.Results:show promising prediction accuracies for potential use in germplasm enhancement and rapid introgression of exotic germplasm into elite materials."

However, most genomic prediction models developed so far are appropriate for Gaussian phenotypes. For this reason, appropriate genomic prediction models are needed for count data, since the conventional regression models used on count data with a large sample size () and a small number of parameters (p) cannot be used for genomic-enabled prediction where the number of parameters (p) is larger than the sample size (). Here, we propose a Bayesian mixed-negative binomial (BMNB) genomic regression model for counts that takes into account genotype by environment  interaction. We also provide all the full conditional distributions to implement a Gibbs sampler. We evaluated the proposed model using a simulated data set, and a real wheat data set from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and collaborators.Results:indicate that our BMNB model provides a viable option for analyzing count data."

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas)†9 is one such means that can target a specific genome locus. It has been applied in human cells and many other organisms. Meanwhile, to efficiently enrich targeted cells, several surrogate systems have also been developed. However, very limited information exists on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in chickens. In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce mutations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> (PPAR-<U+03B3>), ATP synthase epsilon subunit (ATP5E), and ovalbumin (OVA) genes in chicken DF-1 cells. The results of T7E1 assays showed that the mutation rate at the three different loci was 0.75%, 0.5%, and 3.0%, respectively. In order to improve the mutation efficiency, we used the PuroR gene for efficient enrichment of genetically modified cells with the surrogate reporter system. The mutation rate, as assessed via the T7E1 assay, increased to 60.7%, 61.3%, and 47.3%, and subsequent sequence analysis showed that the mutation efficiency increased to 94.7%, 95%, and 95%, respectively. In addition, there were no detectable off-target mutations in three potential off-target sites using the T7E1 assay. As noted above, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a robust tool for chicken genome editing."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/6/4/917.full.pdf"

Genomic selection (GS) is an attractive technology to generate rapid genetic gains in switchgrass, and meet the goals of a substantial displacement of petroleum use with biofuels in the near future. In this study, we empirically assessed prediction procedures for genomic selection in two different populations, consisting of 137 and 110 half-sib families of switchgrass, tested in two locations in the United States for three agronomic traits: dry matter yield, plant height, and heading date. Marker data were produced for the familiesí parents by exome capture sequencing, generating up to 141,030 polymorphic markers with available genomic-location and annotation information. We evaluated prediction procedures that varied not only by learning schemes and prediction models, but also by the way the data were preprocessed to account for redundancy in marker information. More complex genomic prediction procedures were generally not significantly more accurate than the simplest procedure, likely due to limited population sizes. Nevertheless, a highly significant gain in prediction accuracy was achieved by transforming the marker data through a marker correlation matrix. Our results suggest that marker-data transformations and, more generally, the account of linkage disequilibrium among markers, offer valuable opportunities for improving prediction procedures in GS. Some of the achieved prediction accuracies should motivate implementation of GS in switchgrass breeding programs."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/6/4/1049.full.pdf"

The standard implementation is a two-step procedure that uses environment (sample) means as covariates in a within-line ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. This procedure can be suboptimal for at least four reasons: (1) in the first step environmental means are typically estimated without considering genetic-by-environment interactions, (2) in the second step uncertainty about the environmental means is ignored, (3) estimation is performed regarding lines and environment as fixed effects, and (4) the procedure does not incorporate genetic (either pedigree-derived or marker-derived) relationships. Su et al. proposed to address these problems using a Bayesian method that allows simultaneous estimation of environmental and genotype parameters, and allows incorporation of pedigree information. In this article we: (1) extend the model presented by Su et al. to allow integration of genomic information [e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)] and covariance between environments, (2) present an R package (FW) that implements these methods, and (3) illustrate the use of the package using examples based on real data. The FW R package implements both the two-step OLS method and a full Bayesian approach for FinlayñWilkinson regression with a very simple interface. Using a real wheat data set we demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian approach is consistently higher than the one achieved by the two-step OLS method."

However, variability is often heterogeneous across agricultural production systems and may subsequently bias WGP-based inferences. This study extends classical WGP models based on normality, heavy-tailed specifications and variable selection to explicitly account for environmentally-driven residual heteroskedasticity under a hierarchical Bayesian mixed-models framework. WGP models assuming homogeneous or heterogeneous residual variances were fitted to training data generated under simulation scenarios reflecting a gradient of increasing heteroskedasticity. Model fit was based on pseudo-Bayes factors and also on prediction accuracy of genomic breeding values computed on a validation data subset one generation removed from the simulated training dataset. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous residual variance WGP models were also fitted to two quantitative traits, namely 45-min postmortem carcass temperature and loin muscle pH, recorded in a swine resource population dataset prescreened for high and mild residual heteroskedasticity, respectively. Fit of competing WGP models was compared using pseudo-Bayes factors. Predictive ability, defined as the correlation between predicted and observed phenotypes in validation sets of a five-fold cross-validation was also computed. Heteroskedastic error WGP models showed improved model fit and enhanced prediction accuracy compared to homoskedastic error WGP models although the magnitude of the improvement was small (less than two percentage points net gain in prediction accuracy). Nevertheless, accounting for residual heteroskedasticity did improve accuracy of selection, especially on individuals of extreme genetic merit."

Plant breeding programs are characterized by a high degree of structuring, particularly into populations. This hampers the establishment of large training sets for each population. Pooling populations increases training set size but ignores unique genetic characteristics of each. A possible solution is partial pooling with multilevel models, which allows estimating population-specific marker effects while still leveraging information across populations. We developed a Bayesian multilevel whole-genome regression model and compared its performance with that of the popular BayesA model applied to each population separately (no pooling) and to the joined data set (complete pooling). As an example, we analyzed a wide array of traits from the nested association mapping maize population. There we show that for small population sizes (e.g., <50), partial pooling increased prediction accuracy over no or complete pooling for populations represented in the training set. No pooling was superior; however, when populations were large. In another example data set of interconnected biparental maize populations either partial or complete pooling was superior, depending on the trait. A simulation showed that no pooling is superior when differences in genetic effects among populations are large and partial pooling when they are intermediate. With small differences, partial and complete pooling achieved equally high accuracy. For prediction of new populations, partial and complete pooling had very similar accuracy in all cases. We conclude that partial pooling with multilevel models can maximize the potential of pooling by making optimal use of information in pooled training sets."

Because the underlying genetic architecture of the trait of interest is an important factor affecting model selection, we propose a new strategy, termed BLUP|GA (BLUP-given genetic architecture), which can use genetic architecture information within the dataset at hand rather than from public sources. This is achieved by using a trait-specific covariance matrix (T), which is a weighted sum of a genetic architecture part (S matrix) and the realized relationship matrix (G). The algorithm of BLUP|GA (BLUP-given genetic architecture) is provided and illustrated with real and simulated datasets. Predictive ability of BLUP|GA was validated with three model traits in a dairy cattle dataset and 11 traits in three public datasets with a variety of genetic architectures and compared with GBLUP and other approaches.Results:show that BLUP|GA outperformed GBLUP in 20 of 21 scenarios in the dairy cattle dataset and outperformed GBLUP, BayesA, and BayesB in 12 of 13 traits in the analyzed public datasets. Further analyses showed that the difference of accuracies for BLUP|GA and GBLUP significantly correlate with the distance between the T and G matrices. The new strategy applied in BLUP|GA is a favorable and flexible alternative to the standard GBLUP model, allowing to account for the genetic architecture of the quantitative trait under consideration when necessary. This feature is mainly due to the increased similarity between the trait-specific relationship matrix (T matrix) and the genetic relationship matrix at unobserved causal loci. Applying BLUP|GA in WGP would ease the burden of model selection."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/5/4/615.full.pdf"

We compared the M◊E model with a stratified (i.e., within-environment) analysis and with a standard (across-environment) GS model that assumes that effects are constant across environments (i.e., ignoring G◊E). The prediction accuracy of the M◊E model was substantially greater of that of an across-environment analysis that ignores G◊E. Depending on the prediction problem, the M◊E model had either similar or greater levels of prediction accuracy than the stratified analyses. The M◊E model decomposes marker effects and genomic values into components that are stable across environments (main effects) and others that are environment-specific (interactions). Therefore, in principle, the interaction model could shed light over which variants have effects that are stable across environments and which ones are responsible for G◊E. The data set and the scripts required to reproduce the analysis are publicly available as Supporting Information."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/5/4/569.full.pdf"

The aim of this study was to introduce genomic models for analyzing ordinal characters and to assess the predictive ability of genomic predictions for ordered categorical phenotypes using a threshold model counterpart of the Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (i.e., TGBLUP). The threshold model was used to relate a hypothetical underlying scale to the outward categorical response. We present an empirical application where a total of nine models, five without interaction and four with genomic ◊ environment interaction (G◊E) and genomic additive ◊ additive ◊ environment interaction (G◊G◊E), were used. We assessed the proposed models using data consisting of 278 maize lines genotyped with 46,347 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and evaluated for disease resistance [with ordinal scores from 1 (no disease) to 5 (complete infection)] in three environments (Colombia, Zimbabwe, and Mexico). Models with G◊E captured a sizeable proportion of the total variability, which indicates the importance of introducing interaction to improve prediction accuracy. Relative to models based on main effects only, the models that included G◊E achieved 9ñ14% gains in prediction accuracy; adding additive ◊ additive interactions did not increase prediction accuracy consistently across locations."

Its genome is large (> 10 Gb) and contains over 80% repeated sequences. The successful whole-genome-shotgun assembly of the wild emmer (accession Zavitan) genome sequence (WEW_v1.0) was an important milestone for wheat genomics. In an effort to improve this assembly, an optical map of accession Zavitan was constructed using Bionano Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technology. The map spanned 10.4 Gb. This map and another map produced earlier by us with the Bionanoís Nick Label Repair and Stain (NLRS) technology were used to improve the current wild emmer assembly. The WEW_v1.0 assembly consisted of 151,912 scaffolds. Of them, 3,102 could be confidently aligned on the optical maps. Forty-seven were chimeric. They were disjoined and new scaffolds were assembled with the aid of the optical maps. The total number of scaffolds was reduced from 151,912 to 149,252 and N50 increased from 6.96 Mb to 72.63 Mb. Of the 149,252 scaffolds, 485 scaffolds, which accounted for 97% of the total genome length, were aligned and oriented on genetic maps, and new WEW_v2.0 pseudomolecules were constructed. The new pseudomolecules included 333 scaffolds (68.51 Mb) which were originally unassigned, 226 scaffolds (554.84 Mb) were placed into new locations, and 332 scaffolds (394.83 Mb) were re-oriented. The improved wild emmer genome assembly is an important resource for understanding genomic modification that occurred by domestication."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/619.full.pdf"

These ground-nesting bees defend their developing offspring against pathogens and predators, and thus exhibit some of the key traits that preceded insect sociality. Alkali bees are also efficient native pollinators of alfalfa seed, which is a crop of major economic value in the United States. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated a high-quality draft genome of 299.6 Mbp for this species. Repetitive content makes up more than one-third of this genome, and previously uncharacterized transposable elements are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA. We predicted 10,847 protein coding genes, and identify 479 of these undergoing positive directional selection with the use of population genetic analysis based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 19 individuals. We found evidence of recent population bottlenecks, but no significant evidence of population structure. We also identify 45 genes enriched for protein translation and folding, transcriptional regulation, and triglyceride metabolism evolving slower in alkali bees compared to other halictid bees.

It is difficult to trace the sequence of events originating from genomic variants to changes in transcriptional responses or protein modifications. Ideally, one would conduct experiments with individuals that are at either extreme of the trait of interest, but such resources are often not available. Further, advances in genome editing will enable testing of candidate polymorphisms individually and in combination. Here we have created a resource for the study of sleep with 39 inbred lines of Drosophilaóthe Sleep Inbred Panel (SIP). SIP lines have stable long- and short-sleeping phenotypes developed from naturally occurring polymorphisms. These lines are fully sequenced, enabling more accurate targeting for genome editing and transgenic constructs. This panel facilitates the study of intermediate transcriptional and proteomic correlates of sleep, and supports genome editing studies to verify polymorphisms associated with sleep duration."

Here we present the M. demolitor genome (assembly version 2.0), with a genome size of 241 Mb, and a N50 scaffold and contig size of 1.1 Mb and 14 Kb, respectively. Using RNA-Seq data and manual annotation of genes of viral origin, we produced a high-quality gene set that includes 18,586 eukaryotic and 171 virus-derived protein-coding genes. Bracoviruses are dsDNA viruses with unusual genome architecture, in which the viral genome is integrated into the wasp genome and is comprised of two distinct components: proviral segments that are amplified, circularized, and packaged into virions for export into the waspís host via oviposition; and replication genes. This genome assembly revealed that at least two scaffolds contain both nudivirus-like genes and proviral segments, demonstrating that at least some of these components are near each other in the genome on a single chromosome. The updated assembly and annotation are available in several publicly accessible databases; including the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Ag Data Commons. In addition, all raw sequence data available for M. demolitor have been consolidated and are available for visualization at the i5k Workspace. This whole genome assembly and annotation represents the only genome-scale, annotated assembly from the lineage of parasitoid wasps that has associations with bracoviruses (the ëmicrogastroid complexí), providing important baseline knowledge about the architecture of co-opted virus symbiont genomes."

We studied the genome of an important North American boreal forest pest, the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, through a combination of molecular cytogenetic analyses and construction of a high-density linkage map based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained through a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. Cytogenetic analyses using fluorescence in situ hybridization methods confirmed the haploid chromosome number of n = 30 in both sexes of C. fumiferana and showed, for the first time, that this species has a WZ/ZZ sex chromosome system. Synteny analysis based on a comparison of the Bombyx mori genome and the C. fumiferana linkage map revealed the presence of a neo-Z chromosome in the latter species, as previously reported for other tortricid moths. In this neo-Z chromosome, we detected an ABC transporter C2 (ABCC2) gene that has been associated with insecticide resistance. Sex-linkage of the ABCC2 gene provides a genomic context favorable to selection and rapid spread of resistance against Bacillus thuringiensis serotype kurstaki (Btk), the main insecticide used in Canada to control spruce budworm populations. Ultimately, the linkage map we developed, which comprises 3586 SNP markers distributed over 30 linkage groups for a total length of 1720.41 cM, will be a valuable tool for refining our draft assembly of the spruce budworm genome."

Unlike the latter species, S. sisymbriifolium induces eggs of the cyst nematode, Globodera pallida, to hatch and migrate into its roots, but then arrests further nematode maturation. In order to provide researchers with a partial blueprint of its genetic make-up so that the mechanism of this response might be identified, we used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing to compile a high quality de novo transcriptome of 41,189 unigenes drawn from individually sequenced bud, root, stem, and leaf RNA populations. Functional annotation and BUSCO analysis showed that this transcriptome was surprisingly complete, even though it represented genes expressed at a single time point. By sequencing the 4 organ libraries separately, we found we could get a reliable snapshot of transcript distributions in each organ. A divergent site analysis of the merged transcriptome indicated that this species might have undergone a recent genome duplication and re-diploidization. Further analysis indicated that the plant then retained a disproportionate number of genes associated with photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism in comparison to genes with characteristics of R-proteins or involved in secondary metabolism. The former processes may have given S. sisymbriifolium a bigger competitive advantage than the latter did."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/8/7/2135.full.pdf"

Here, we present the first complete genome for a behaviorally and ecologically unique member of the sister clade to house mice, the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. Using read cloud sequencing and de novo assembly we produced a 2.50 Gbp genome with a scaffold N50 of 2.27 Mbp. We constructed >25 000 gene models, of which the majority had high homology to other Mus species. To evaluate the utility of the M. spicilegus genome for behavioral and ecological genomics, we extracted 196 vomeronasal receptor (VR) sequences from our genome and analyzed phylogenetic relationships between M. spicilegus VRs and orthologs from M. musculus and the Algerian mouse, M. spretus. While most M. spicilegus VRs clustered with orthologs in M. musculus and M. spretus, 10 VRs with evidence of rapid divergence in M. spicilegus are strong candidate modulators of species-specific chemical communication. A high quality assembly and genome for M. spicilegus will help to resolve discordant ancestry patterns in house mouse genomes, and will provide an essential foundation for genetic dissection of phenotypes that distinguish commensal from non-commensal species, and the social and ecological characteristics that make M. spicilegus unique."

We generated Illumina short read data from paired-end libraries and in vitro proximity-ligation libraries. We obtained 54.9◊ coverage, N50 contig length of 17.6 kb, and N50 scaffold length of 6.65 Mb. Compared to two other species in the Poeciliidae family, G. affinis has slightly fewer genes that have shorter total, exon, and intron length on average. Using a set of universal single-copy orthologs in fish genomes, we found 95.5% of these genes were complete in the G. affinis assembly. The number of transposable elements in the G. affinis assembly is similar to those of closely related species.

It also has a broad prospect of application in pharmaceutical industries, with many medicinal activities. In this study, the whole genome of C. guangdongensis GD15, a single spore isolate from a wild strain, was sequenced and assembled with Illumina and PacBio sequencing technology. The generated genome is 29.05 Mb in size, comprising nine scaffolds with an average GC content of 57.01%. It is predicted to contain a total of 9150 protein-coding genes. Sequence identification and comparative analysis indicated that the assembled scaffolds contained two complete chromosomes and four single-end chromosomes, showing a high level assembly. Gene annotation revealed a diversity of transposons that could contribute to the genome size and evolution. Besides, approximately 15.57% and 12.01% genes involved in metabolic processes were annotated by KEGG and COG respectively. Genes belonging to CAZymes accounted for 3.15% of the total genes. In addition, 435 transcription factors, involved in various biological processes, were identified. Among the identified transcription factors, the fungal transcription regulatory proteins (18.39%) and fungal-specific transcription factors (19.77%) represented the two largest classes of transcription factors.

The study of the breakdown of these molecules is thus a central question in biology. Surprisingly, plant cell wall breakdown by herbivores is relatively poorly understood, as nearly all early work focused on the mechanisms used by symbiotic microbes to breakdown plant cell walls in insects such as termites. Recently, however, it has been shown that many organisms make endogenous cellulases. Insects, and other arthropods, in particular have been shown to express a variety of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in many gene families with the ability to break down all the major components of the plant cell wall. Here we report the genome of a walking stick, Medauroidea extradentata, an obligate herbivore that makes uses of endogenously produced plant cell wall degrading enzymes. We present a draft of the 3.3Gbp genome along with an official gene set that contains a diversity of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. We show that at least one of the major families of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the pectinases, have undergone a striking lineage-specific gene family expansion in the Phasmatodea. This genome will be a useful resource for comparative evolutionary studies with herbivores in many other clades and will help elucidate the mechanisms by which metazoans breakdown plant cell wall components."

Seven genomic regions under putative selection were identified, and these regions contained nine genes. Among these genes, T was the strongest candidate as T is related to vertebral development. In T, a nonsynonymous mutation at c.G334T resulted in p.G112W substitution.

To date, three necrotrophic effectors have been identified and characterized from this pathogen, including SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3. Necrotrophic effector identification was greatly aided by the development of a draft genome of Australian isolate SN15 via Sanger sequencing, yet it remained largely fragmented. This research presents the development of nearly finished genomes of P. nodorum isolates Sn4, Sn2000, and Sn79-1087 using long-read sequencing technology. RNAseq analysis of isolate Sn4, consisting of eight time points covering various developmental and infection stages, mediated the annotation of 13,379 genes. Analysis of these genomes revealed large-scale polymorphism between the three isolates, including the complete absence of contig 23 from isolate Sn79-1087, and a region of genome expansion on contig 10 in isolates Sn4 and Sn2000. Additionally, these genomes exhibit the hallmark characteristics of a ìtwo-speedî genome, being partitioned into two distinct GC-equilibrated and AT-rich compartments. Interestingly, isolate Sn79-1087 contains a lower proportion of AT-rich segments, indicating a potential lack of evolutionary hotspots. These newly sequenced genomes, consisting of telomere-to-telomere assemblies of nearly all 23 P. nodorum chromosomes, provide a robust foundation for the further examination of effector biology and genome evolution."

Typical yield losses due to NFNB range from 10 to 40%; however, complete loss has been observed on highly susceptible barley lines where environmental conditions favor the pathogen. Currently, genomic resources for this economically important pathogen are limited to a fragmented draft genome assembly and annotation, with limited RNA support of the P. teres f. teres isolate 0-1. This research presents an updated 0-1 reference assembly facilitated by long-read sequencing and scaffolding with the assistance of genetic linkage maps. Additionally, genome annotation was mediated by RNAseq analysis using three infection time points and a pure culture sample, resulting in 11,541 high-confidence gene models. The 0-1 genome assembly and annotation presented here now contains the majority of the repetitive content of the genome. Analysis of the 0-1 genome revealed classic characteristics of a ìtwo-speedî genome, being compartmentalized into GC-equilibrated and AT-rich compartments. The assembly of repetitive AT-rich regions will be important for future investigation of genes known as effectors, which often reside in close proximity to repetitive regions. These effectors are responsible for manipulation of the host defense during infection. This updated P. teres f. teres isolate 0-1 reference genome assembly and annotation provides a robust resource for the examination of the barleyñP. teres f. teres hostñpathogen coevolution."

Utilizing existing RNA-Seq data for this species, as well as publicly available peptide sequences from related Hymenoptera, a high quality gene annotation set, which includes 10,991 protein coding genes, was generated. Prior to this assembly submission, no RefSeq proteins were present for this species. Parasitic wasps play an important role in a diverse ecosystem as well as a role in biological control of agricultural pests.

Few eukaryotic extremophiles have been well studied and only a small number are amenable to laboratory cultivation and manipulation. A detailed characterization of the genome architecture of such organisms is important to illuminate how they adapt to environmental stresses. One excellent example of a fungal extremophile is the halophile Hortaea werneckii (Pezizomycotina, Dothideomycetes, Capnodiales), a yeast-like fungus able to thrive at near-saturating concentrations of sodium chloride and which is also tolerant to both UV irradiation and desiccation. Given its unique lifestyle and its remarkably recent whole genome duplication, H. werneckii provides opportunities for testing the role of genome duplications and adaptability to extreme environments. We previously assembled the genome of H. werneckii using short-read sequencing technology and found a remarkable degree of gene duplication. Technology limitations, however, precluded high-confidence annotation of the entire genome. We therefore revisited the H. wernickii genome using long-read, single-molecule sequencing and provide an improved genome assembly which, combined with transcriptome and nucleosome analysis, provides a useful resource for fungal halophile genomics. Remarkably, the ~50 Mb H. wernickii genome contains 15,974 genes of which 95% (7608) are duplicates formed by a recent whole genome duplication (WGD), with an average of 5% protein sequence divergence between them. We found that the WGD is extraordinarily recent, and compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the majority of the genomeís ohnologs have not diverged at the level of gene expression of chromatin structure."

In the 1970s, the soft-shelled tick Ornithodoros coriaceus, or ìpajaroello tick,î was confirmed as the disease-transmitting vector. In 2005, a novel Deltaproteobacterium was discovered as the etiologic agent of EBA (aoEBA), recently named Pajaroellobacter abortibovis. This organism cannot be grown in culture using traditional microbiological techniques; it can only be grown in experimentally-infected severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The objectives of this study were to perform a de novo genome assembly for P. abortibovis and identify and validate potential antigenic proteins as candidates for future recombinant vaccine development. DNA and RNA were extracted from spleen tissue collected from experimentally-infected SCID mice following exposure to P. abortibovis. This combination of mouse and bacterial DNA was sequenced and aligned to the mouse genome. Mouse sequences were subtracted from the sequence pool and the remaining sequences were de novo assembled at 50x coverage into a 1.82 Mbp complete closed circular Deltaproteobacterial genome containing 2250 putative protein-coding sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of P. abortibovis predicts that this bacterium is most closely related to the organisms of the order Myxococcales, referred to as Myxobacteria. In silico prediction of vaccine candidates was performed using a reverse vaccinology approach resulting in the identification and ranking of the top 10 candidate proteins that are likely to be antigenic. Immunologic testing of these candidate proteins confirmed antigenicity of seven of the nine expressed protein candidates using serum from P. abortibovis immunized mice."

Over the past 50 years, there have been numerous and powerful advances to meet this challenge, including next-generation sequencing approaches (Jackson et al. 2011), molecular genetic mapping techniques, computational modeling, and the integration of evolutionary theory and tools. In plants, the long history of domestication and breeding has provided multiple insights into the genotypeñphenotype equation (Meyer and Purugganan 2013; Olsen and Wendel 2013). Domestication and breeding provide unique systems with which to study the evolution of traits and adaptation to new environments. At present, agriculture faces unprecedented challenges, with the need to continue to increase food quality and food production for a population that will likely exceed 9 billion by 2050, combined with the urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable in an environment that will be altered by climate change (Diouf 2009). Crop wild relatives, however, have evolved under ecological settings that often are more extreme than those under cultivation and thus represent a reservoir of useful adaptive traits. This genetic diversity has mostly been untapped because of a lack of appropriate tools, both at the genetic level and in describing plant phenotypes and adaptation (Mace et al. 2013). In this context, crop improvement needs to undergo a qualitative leap forward by exploiting the knowledge from the interface of the fields of molecular evolution, bioinformatics, plant physiology, and genetics."

Defective stress responses are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Phenol derivatives, naturally occurring and synthetic, display beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The phenol derivatives in this study, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol A (BPA), are widely used as food preservatives and industrial chemicals. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their biological activity and correlation with disease development; understanding the molecular basis of phenol action is a key step for addressing issues relevant to human health. This work presents the first comparative genomic analysis of the genetic networks for phenol stress response in an evolutionary context of two divergent yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomic screening of deletion strain libraries of the two yeasts identified genes required for cellular response to phenol stress, which are enriched in human orthologs. Functional analysis of these genes uncovered the major signaling pathways involved. The results provide a global view of the biological events constituting the defense process, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, phenol detoxification by V-ATPases, reactive oxygen species alleviation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress relief through ergosterol and the unfolded protein response, revealing novel roles for these cellular pathways."

In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization. We generated a random transposon mutant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 comprising 39,500 unique insertions and identified genes required for growth in culture and on corn roots. A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the INSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5- to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport.

ALT mechanisms were first seen, and have been best studied, in telomerase-null Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells called ìsurvivorsî. There are two main types of survivors. Type I survivors amplify Y' subtelomeric elements while type II survivors, similar to the majority of human ALT cells, amplify the terminal telomeric repeats. Both types of survivors require Rad52, a key homologous recombination protein, and Pol32, a non-essential subunit of DNA polymerase d. A number of additional proteins have been reported to be important for either type I or type II survivor formation, but it is still unclear how these two pathways maintain telomeres. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen to identify novel genes that are important for the formation of type II ALT-like survivors. We identified 23 genes that disrupt type II survivor formation when deleted. 17 of these genes had not been previously reported to do so. Several of these genes (DUN1, CCR4, and MOT2) are known to be involved in the regulation of dNTP levels. We find that dNTP levels are elevated early after telomerase inactivation and that this increase favors the formation of type II survivors."

The ability of the ChO to sense the relative displacement of its epidermal attachment sites likely depends on the correct mechanical properties of the accessory (cap and ligament) and attachment cells that connect the sensory unit (neuron and scolopale cell) to the cuticle. The genetic programs dictating the development of ChO cells with unique morphologies and mechanical properties are largely unknown. Here we describe an RNAi screen that focused on the ChOís accessory and attachment cells and was performed in 2nd instar larvae to allow for phenotypic analysis of ChOs that had already experienced mechanical stresses during larval growth. Nearly one thousand strains carrying RNAi constructs targeting more than 500 candidate genes were screened for their effects on ChO morphogenesis. The screen identified 31 candidate genes whose knockdown within the ChO lineage disrupted various aspects of cell fate determination, cell differentiation, cellular morphogenesis and cell-cell attachment. Most interestingly, one phenotypic group consisted of genes that affected the response of specific ChO cell types to developmental organ stretching, leading to abnormal pattern of cell elongation. The ëcell elongationí group included the transcription factors Delilah and Stripe, implicating them for the first time in regulating the response of ChO cells to developmental stretching forces. Other genes found to affect the pattern of ChO cell elongation, such as aTub85E, ﬂ1Tub56D, Tbce, CCT8, mys, Rac1 and shot, represent putative effectors that link between cell-fate determinants and the realization of cell-specific mechanical properties."

We have previously shown that, if ELT-2 is expressed sufficiently early, it is also able to specify the endoderm and to replace all other members of the core GATA-factor transcriptional cascade (END-1, END-3, ELT-7). However, such rescue requires multiple copies (and presumably overexpression) of the end-1p::elt-2 cDNA transgene; a single copy of the transgene does not rescue. We have made this observation the basis of a genetic screen to search for genetic modifiers that allow a single copy of the end-1p::elt-2 cDNA transgene to rescue the lethality of the end-1 end-3 double mutant. We performed this screen on a strain that has a single copy insertion of the transgene in an end-1 end-3 background. These animals are kept alive by virtue of an extrachromosomal array containing multiple copies of the rescuing transgene; the extrachromosomal array also contains a toxin under heat shock control to counterselect for mutagenized survivors that have been able to lose the rescuing array. A screen of ~14,000 mutagenized haploid genomes produced 17 independent surviving strains. Whole genome sequencing was performed to identify genes that incurred independent mutations in more than one surviving strain. The C. elegans gene tasp-1 was mutated in four independent strains. tasp-1 encodes the C. elegans homolog of Taspase, a threonine-aspartic acid protease that has been found, in both mammals and insects, to cleave several proteins involved in transcription, in particular MLL1/trithorax and TFIIA. A second gene, pqn-82, was mutated in two independent strains and encodes a glutamine-asparagine rich protein. tasp-1 and pqn-82 were verified as loss-of-function modifiers of the end-1p::elt-2 transgene by RNAi and by CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations. In both cases, gene loss leads to modest increases in the level of ELT-2 protein in the early endoderm although ELT-2 levels do not strictly correlate with rescue. We suggest that tasp-1 and pqn-82 represent a class of genes acting in the early embryo to modulate levels of critical transcription factors or to modulate the responsiveness of critical target genes. The screenís design, rescuing lethality with an extrachromosomal transgene followed by counterselection, has a background survival rate of <10-4 without mutagenesis and should be readily adapted to the general problem of identifying suppressors of C. elegans lethal mutations."

We report here the results of a screen of selected mutants from the Neurospora knockout library for alterations in their morphological response to cold shock. Three groups of knockouts were selected to be subject to this screen: genes previously suspected to be involved in hyphal development as well as knockouts resulting in morphological changes; transcription factors; and genes homologous to E. coli genes known to alter their expression in response to cold shock. A total of 344 knockout strains were subjected to cold shock. Of those, 118 strains were identified with altered responses. We report here the cold shock morphologies and GO categorizations of strains subjected to this screen. Of strains with knockouts in genes associated with hyphal growth or morphology, 33 of 131 tested (25%) showed an altered response to cold shock. Of strains with knockouts in transcription factor genes, 30 of 145 (20%) showed an altered response to cold shock. Of strains with knockouts in genes homologous to E. coli genes which display altered levels of transcription in response to cold shock, a total of 55 of 68 tested (81%) showed an altered cold shock response.

We were unable to create site-directed mutants for each of the predicted genes in Acetobacter, so we created an arrayed transposon insertion library using Acetobacter fabarum DsW_054 isolated from Drosophila. Creation of the A. fabarum DsW_054 gene knock-out library was performed by combinatorial mapping and Illumina sequencing of random transposon insertion mutants. Transposon insertion locations for 6,418 mutants were successfully mapped, including hits within 63% of annotated genes in the A. fabarum DsW_054 genome. For 45/45 members of the library, insertion sites were verified by arbitrary PCR and Sanger sequencing. Mutants with insertions in four different LPS biosynthesis genes were selected from the library to validate the MGWA predictions. Insertion mutations in two genes biosynthetically upstream of Lipid-A formation, lpxC and lpxB, show significant differences in host association, whereas mutations in two genes encoding LPS biosynthesis functions downstream of Lipid-A biosynthesis had no effect. These results suggest an impact of bacterial cell surface molecules on the bacterial capacity for host association.

In contrast, the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has enabled gene discovery in mutant lines maintained on an inbred genetic background. This approach utilizes genetic variation derived from ENU-induced variants for mapping and reduces the likelihood of phenotypic variation, making it an ideal method for genetic modifier screening. Here, we describe the results of such a screen, wherein we determined the minimal number of mutant genomic DNA samples to include in our analyses and improved the sensitivity of our screen by individually barcoding each genomic DNA library.

Incoming sugar, for example, can be fermented or respired, depending on the carbon identity, cell type, or growth conditions. Despite this genetically-encoded flexibility of carbon metabolism, attempts to exogenously manipulate central carbon flux by rational design have proven difficult, suggesting a robust network structure. To examine this robustness, we characterized the ethanol yield of 411 regulatory and metabolic mutants in budding yeast. The mutants showed little variation in ethanol productivity when grown on glucose or galactose, yet diversity was revealed during growth on xylulose, a rare pentose not widely available in nature. While producing ethanol at high yield, cells grown on xylulose produced ethanol at high yields, yet induced expression of respiratory genes, and were dependent on them. Analysis of mutants that affected ethanol productivity suggested that xylulose fermentation results from metabolic overflow, whereby the flux through glycolysis is higher than the maximal flux that can enter respiration. We suggest that this overflow results from a suboptimal regulatory adjustment of the cells to this unfamiliar carbon source."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/7/6/1743.full.pdf"

We have screened the entire yeast heterozygous deletion collection to identify strains haploinsufficient for growth in the presence of sulfometuron methyl, which causes starvation for isoleucine and valine. We have discovered that cells devoid of MET15 are sensitive to sulfometuron methyl, and loss of heterozygosity at the MET15 locus can complicate screening the heterozygous deletion collection. We identified 138 cases of loss of heterozygosity in this screen. After eliminating the issues of the MET15 loss of heterozygosity, strains isolated from the collection were retested on sulfometuron methyl. To determine the general effect of the mutations for a starvation response, SMM-sensitive strains were tested for the ability to grow in the presence of canavanine, which induces arginine starvation, and strains that were MET15 were also tested for growth in the presence of ethionine, which causes methionine starvation. Many of the genes identified in our study were not previously identified as starvation-responsive genes, including a number of essential genes that are not easily screened in a systematic way. The genes identified span a broad range of biological functions, including many involved in some level of gene expression.

While a comprehensive survey of cell size genetic determinism has been performed in the saprophytic yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, very little is known in pathogenic fungi. As a number of critical Start regulators are haploinsufficient for cell size, we applied a quantitative analysis of the size phenome, using elutriation-barcode sequencing methodology, to 5639 barcoded heterozygous deletion strains of the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans. Our screen identified conserved known regulators and biological processes required to maintain size homeostasis in the opportunistic yeast C. albicans. We also identified novel C. albicans-specific size genes and provided a conceptual framework for future mechanistic studies. Interestingly, some of the size genes identified were required for fungal pathogenicity suggesting that cell size homeostasis may be elemental to C. albicans fitness or virulence inside the host."

While the transcriptional targets of ecdysone signaling during development have been studied extensively, targets in the ovary remain largely unknown. Early studies of salivary gland polytene chromosomes led to a model in which ecdysone stimulates a hierarchical transcriptional cascade, wherein a core group of ecdysone-sensitive transcription factors induce tissue-specific responses by activating secondary branches of transcriptional targets. More recently, genome-wide approaches have identified hundreds of putative ecdysone-responsive targets. Determining whether these putative targets represent bona fide targets in vivo, however, requires that they be tested via traditional mutant analysis in a cell-type specific fashion. To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby ecdysone signaling regulates oogenesis, we used genetic mosaic analysis to screen putative ecdysone-responsive genes for novel roles in the control of the earliest steps of oogenesis. We identified a cohort of genes required for stem cell maintenance, stem and progenitor cell proliferation, and follicle encapsulation, growth, and survival. These genes encode transcription factors, chromatin modulators, and factors required for RNA transport, stability, and ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that ecdysone might control a wide range of molecular processes during oogenesis. Our results suggest that, although ecdysone target genes are known to have cell type-specific roles, many ecdysone response genes that control larval or pupal cell types at developmental transitions are used reiteratively in the adult ovary. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which ecdysone signaling controls oogenesis, laying new ground for future studies."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, small germ granules are present in the germ line that share characteristics with liquid droplets that undergo phase transitions. In meiotically-arrested oocytes of middle-aged hermaphrodites, the germ granules appear to aggregate or condense into large assemblies of RNA-binding proteins and maternal mRNAs. Prior characterization of the assembly of large-scale RNP structures via candidate approaches has identified a small number of regulators of phase transitions in the C. elegans germ line; however, the assembly, function, and regulation of these large RNP assemblies remain incompletely understood. To identify genes that promote remodeling and assembly of large RNP granules in meiotically-arrested oocytes, we performed a targeted, functional RNAi screen and identified over 300 genes that regulate the assembly of the RNA-binding protein MEX-3 into large granules. Among the most common GO classes are several categories related to RNA biology, as well as novel categories such as cell cortex, ER, and chromosome segregation. We found that arrested oocytes that fail to localize MEX-3 into cortical granules display reduced oocyte quality, consistent with the idea that the larger RNP assemblies promote oocyte quality when fertilization is delayed. Interestingly, a relatively small number of genes overlap with the regulators of germ granule assembly during normal development, or with the regulators of solid RNP granules in cgh-1 oocytes, suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of RNP granule phase transitions during meiotic arrest."

Initial association of cohesin with chromosomes requires the loaderóa heterodimer composed of Scc4 and Scc2. However, very little is known about the loaderís mechanism of action. In this study, we performed a genetic screen to identify functional domains in the Scc4 subunit of the loader. We isolated scc4 mutant alleles that, when overexpressed, have a dominant negative effect on cell viability. We defined a small region in the N terminus of Scc4 that is dominant negative when overexpressed, and on which Scc2/Scc4 activity depends. When the mutant alleles are expressed as a single copy, they are recessive and do not support cell viability, cohesion, cohesin loading or Scc4 chromatin binding. In addition, we show that the mutants investigated reduce, but do not eliminate, the interaction of Scc4 with either Scc2 or cohesin. However, we show that Scc4 cannot bind cohesin in the absence of Scc2. Our results provide new insight into the roles of Scc4 in cohesin loading, and contribute to deciphering the loading mechanism."

Nevertheless, chromosomes carrying P element insertions tend to have high levels of background mutations from P elements inserting and excising during transposition. Consequently, the phenotypes seen when P element-bearing chromosomes are homozygous are often not attributable to the P insertions themselves. In this study, 178 strains in the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center collection with P insertions on the second chromosome were complementation tested against molecularly defined chromosomal deletions and previously characterized single-gene mutations to determine if recessive lethality or sterility is associated with the P insertions rather than background mutations.

Our objectives were to facilitate the breeding of high-yield, high-quality chicken strains, and to investigate gene function in chicken stem cells. Three guide RNA (gRNAs) were designed to knockout the C2EIP gene, and knockout efficiency was evaluated in DF-1 chicken fibroblasts and chicken ESCs using the luciferase single-strand annealing (SSA) recombination assay, T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay, and TA clone sequencing. In addition, the polyethylenimine-encapsulated Cas9/gRNA plasmid was injected into fresh fertilized eggs. At 4.5†d later, frozen sections of the embryos were prepared, and knockout efficiency was evaluated by the T7EI assay. SSA assay results showed that luciferase activity of the vector expressing gRNA-3 was double that of the control.Results:of the T7EI assay and TA clone sequencing indicated that Cas9/gRNA vector-mediated gene knockdown efficiency was approximately 27% in both DF-1 cells and ESCs. The CRISPR/Cas9 vector was also expressed in chicken embryos, resulting in gene knockdown in three of the 20 embryos (gene knockdown efficiency 15%). Taken together, our results indicate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can mediate stable gene knockdown at the cell and embryo levels in domestic chickens."

Pheromones produced by conspecific individuals provide critical information regarding environmental conditions. Ascaroside pheromone concentration and composition are instructive in the decision of Caenorhabditis elegans to either develop into a reproductive adult or enter into the stress-resistant alternate dauer developmental stage. Pheromones are sensed by a small set of sensory neurons, and integrated with additional environmental cues, to regulate neuroendocrine signaling and dauer formation. To identify molecules required for pheromone-induced dauer formation, we performed an unbiased forward genetic screen and identified phd (pheromone response-defective dauer) mutants. Here, we describe new roles in dauer formation for previously identified neuronal molecules such as the WD40 domain protein QUI-1 and MACO-1 Macoilin, report new roles for nociceptive neurons in modulating pheromone-induced dauer formation, and identify tau tubulin kinases as new genes involved in dauer formation. Thus, phd mutants define loci required for the detection, transmission, or integration of pheromone signals in the regulation of dauer formation."

As a result, it constitutes a simplistic and desirable vertebrate model for developmental genetics as it is easily maintained, reaches sexual maturity in about 100 days, and provides a manageable number of relatively clear embryos. After the establishment and characterization of an initial mutagenesis pilot screen using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, a three-generation genetic screen was performed to confirm zygotic mutant allele heritability and simultaneously score for homozygous recessive mutant sterile F2 fish. From a total of 307 F2 fish screened, 10 were found to be 1∞ males, 16 were sterile, 92 wild-type, and the remaining 189, carriers of zygotic recessive alleles. These carriers produced 25% progeny exhibiting several zygotic phenotypes similar to those previously described in zebrafish and in the aforementioned pilot screen, as expected. Interestingly, new phenotypes such as golden yolk, no trunk, and short tail were observed. The siblings of sterile F2 mutants were used to produce an F3 generation in order to confirm familial sterility. Out of the 284 F3 fish belonging to 10 previously identified sterile families, 12 were found to be 1∞ males, 69 were wild-type, 83 sterile, and 120 were classified as */+ (either wild-type or carriers) with undefined genotypes. This screen provides proof of principle that K. marmoratus is a powerful vertebrate model for developmental genetics and can be used to identify mutations affecting fertility."

Gain-of-function mutations of mec-4 and mec-4(d) result in a hyperactive channel and neurodegeneration in vivo. Loss of MEC-6, a putative DEG/ENaC-specific chaperone, and of the similar protein POML-1 suppresses the neurodegeneration caused by a mec-4(d) mutation. We find that mutation of two genes, mec-10 and a new gene mec-19 (previously named C49G9.1), prevents this action of POML-1, allowing the touch receptor neurons to die in poml-1 mec-4(d) animals. The proteins encoded by these genes normally inhibit mec-4(d) neurotoxicity through different mechanisms. MEC-10, a subunit of the mechanosensory transduction channel with MEC-4, inhibits MEC-4(d) activity without affecting MEC-4 expression. In contrast, MEC-19, a membrane protein specific to nematodes, inhibits MEC-4(d) activity and reduces MEC-4 surface expression."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/6/4/1121.full.pdf"

Sirtuins regulate processes such as transcription, DNA damage repair, chromosome segregation, and longevity extension in yeast and metazoans. The founding member of the evolutionarily conserved sirtuin family, SIR2, was first identified in budding yeast. Subsequent studies led to the identification of four yeast SIR2 homologs HST1, HST2, HST3, and HST4. Understanding the downstream physiological consequences of inhibiting sirtuins can be challenging since most studies focus on single or double deletions of sirtuins, and mating defects in SIR2 deletions hamper genome-wide screens. This represents an important gap in our knowledge of how sirtuins function in highly complex biological processes such as aging, metabolism, and chromosome segregation. In this report, we used a genome-wide screen to explore sirtuin-dependent processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by identifying deletion mutants that are sensitive to NAM. We identified 55 genes in total, 36 of which have not been previously reported to be dependent on sirtuins. We find that genome stability pathways are particularly vulnerable to loss of sirtuin activity. Here, we provide evidence that defects in sister chromatid cohesion renders cells sensitive to growth in the presence of NAM. The results of our screen provide a broad view of the biological pathways sensitive to inhibition of sirtuins, and advance our understanding of the function of sirtuins and NAD+ biology."

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna2 has both helicase and nuclease activities that are essential for Okazaki fragment maturation, and Dna2 is involved in long-range DNA end resection at double-strand breaks. Dna2 forms nuclear foci in response to DNA replication stress and to double-strand breaks. We find that Dna2-GFP focus formation occurs mainly during S phase in unperturbed cells. Dna2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with 25 DNA repair proteins that define recombination repair centers in response to phleomycin-induced DNA damage. To systematically identify genes that affect Dna2 focus formation, we crossed Dna2-GFP into 4293 nonessential gene deletion mutants and assessed Dna2-GFP nuclear focus formation after phleomycin treatment. We identified 37 gene deletions that affect Dna2-GFP focus formation, 12 with fewer foci and 25 with increased foci. Together these data comprise a useful resource for understanding Dna2 regulation in response to DNA damage."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/5/9/1937.full.pdf"

They undergo asymmetric cell divisions, slow cellular expansion, acquire significant stress tolerance and construct elaborate cell walls. These morphologic changes give rise to quiescent (Q) cells, which can be distinguished from three other cell types in a stationary phase culture by flow cytometry. We have used flow cytometry to screen for genes that are required to obtain the quiescent cell fraction. We find that cell wall integrity is critical and these genes may help define quiescence-specific features of the cell wall. Genes required to evade the host innate immune response are common. These may be new targets for antifungal drugs. Acquired thermotolerance is also a common property, and we show that the stress-response transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 promote quiescence. Many other pathways also contribute, including a subset of genes involved in autophagy, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA replication, bud site selection, and cytokinesis."

Protein phosphatases are essential to several signal transduction pathways. We identified 32 phosphatase catalytic subunit-encoding genes in A. fumigatus, of which we were able to construct 24 viable deletion mutants. The role of nine phosphatase mutants in the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol response) pathway was evaluated by measuring phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK (SakA) and expression of osmo-dependent genes. We were also able to identify 11 phosphatases involved in iron assimilation, six that are related to gliotoxin resistance, and three implicated in gliotoxin production.

Our approach takes advantage of the strongly DNA damage-inducible gene RNR3, in conjunction with the reporter synthetic genetic array methodology, to infer mutants exhibiting genome instability by assaying for increased Rnr3 abundance. We screen for genome instability across a set of ~1000 essential and ~4200 nonessential mutant yeast alleles in untreated conditions and in the presence of the DNA-damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate. Our results provide broad insights into the cellular processes and pathways required for genome maintenance. Through comparison with existing genome instability screens, we isolated 130 genes that had not previously been linked to genome maintenance, 51% of which have human homologs. Several of these homologs are associated with a genome instability phenotype in human cells or are causally mutated in cancer. A comprehensive understanding of the processes required to prevent genome instability will facilitate a better understanding of its sources in oncogenesis."

Although genetic screens and microarray analyses have identified several genes needed for touch sensitivity, these methods miss pleiotropic genes that are essential for the viability, movement, or fertility of the animals. We used neuronally enhanced feeding RNA interference to screen genes that cause lethality or paralysis when mutated, and we identified 61 such genes affecting touch sensitivity, including five positive controls. We confirmed 18 genes by using available alleles, and further studied one of them, tag-170, now renamed txdc-9. txdc-9 preferentially affects anterior touch response but is needed for tubulin acetylation and microtubule formation in both the anterior and posterior touch receptor neurons. Our results indicate that neuronally enhanced feeding RNA interference screens complement traditional mutageneses by identifying additional nonviable genes needed for specific neuronal functions."

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have a major role in Drosophila melanogaster mesoderm migration; however, few other inputs are known and the mechanism supporting cell movement is unclear. To provide insight, we performed an ectopic expression screen to identify secreted or membrane-associated molecules that act to support mesoderm migration. Twenty-four UAS insertions were identified that cause lethality when expressed in either the mesoderm (Twi-Gal4) or the ectoderm (69B-Gal4). The list was narrowed to a subset of 10 genes that were shown to exhibit loss-of-function mutant phenotypes specifically affecting mesoderm migration. These include the FGF ligand Pyramus, a-integrins, E-cadherin, Cueball, EGFR, JAK/STAT signaling components, as well as the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) Terribly reduced optic lobes (Trol). Trol encodes the ortholog of mammalian HSPG Perlecan, a demonstrated FGF signaling cofactor. Here, we examine the role of Trol in Drosophila mesoderm migration and compare and contrast its role with that of Syndecan (Sdc), another HSPG previously implicated in this process. Embryos mutant for Trol or Sdc were obtained and analyzed. Our data support the view that both HSPGs function to support FGF-dependent processes in the early embryo as they share phenotypes with FGF mutants: Trol in terms of effects on mesoderm migration and caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM) migration and Sdc in terms of dorsal mesoderm specification. The differential roles uncovered for these two HSPGs suggest that HSPG cofactor choice may modify FGF-signaling outputs."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/5/2/301.full.pdf"

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an emerging genetic model to analyze cellular aging. Chronological lifespan (CLS) has been studied in stationary-phase yeast cells depleted for glucose, which only survive for a few days. Here, we analyzed CLS in quiescent S. pombe cells deprived of nitrogen, which arrest in a differentiated, G0-like state and survive for more than 2 months. We applied parallel mutant phenotyping by barcode sequencing (Bar-seq) to assay pooled haploid deletion mutants as they aged together during long-term quiescence. As expected, mutants with defects in autophagy or quiescence were under-represented or not detected. Lifespan scores could be calculated for 1199 mutants. We focus the discussion on the 48 most long-lived mutants, including both known aging genes in other model systems and genes not previously implicated in aging. Genes encoding membrane proteins were particularly prominent as pro-aging factors. We independently verified the extended CLS in individual assays for 30 selected mutants, showing the efficacy of the screen. We also applied Bar-seq to profile all pooled deletion mutants for proliferation under a standard growth condition. Unlike for stationary-phase cells, no inverse correlation between growth and CLS of quiescent cells was evident. These screens provide a rich resource for further studies, and they suggest that the quiescence model can provide unique, complementary insights into cellular aging."

A high-throughput genetic method was used to introduce each mutant into an h90 background, and iodine staining was used to identify sporulation-defective mutants. The screen identified 34 genes whose deletion reduces sporulation, including 15 that are defective in forespore membrane morphogenesis.

Bayesian genotype calling can mitigate these issues, but previously has only been implemented in software that requires a reference genome or uses priors that may be inappropriate for the population. Here we present several novel Bayesian algorithms that estimate genotype posterior probabilities, all of which are implemented in a new R package, polyRAD. Appropriate priors can be specified for mapping populations, populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or structured populations, and in each case can be informed by genotypes at linked markers.

However, only a small number of studies have been reported in horticultural crops, and in polyploid species in particular. In this paper, we have developed a versatile forward simulation tool, called polyploid Sequence Based Virtual Breeding (pSBVB), to evaluate GS strategies in polyploids; pSBVB is an efficient gene dropping software that can simulate any number of complex phenotypes, allowing a very flexible modeling of phenotypes suited to polyploids. As input, it takes genotype data from the founder population, which can vary from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chips up to sequence, a list of causal variants for every trait and their heritabilities, and the pedigree. Recombination rates between homeologous chromosomes can be specified, so that both allo- and autopolyploid species can be considered. The program outputs phenotype and genotype data for all individuals in the pedigree. Optionally, it can produce several genomic relationship matrices that consider exact or approximate genotype values. pSBVB can therefore be used to evaluate GS strategies in polyploid species (say varying SNP density, genetic architecture or population size, among other factors), or to optimize experimental designs for association studies. We illustrate pSBVB with SNP data from tetraploid potato and partial sequence data from octoploid strawberry, and we show that GS is a promising breeding strategy for polyploid species but that the actual advantage critically depends on the underlying genetic architecture.

The eigen-decomposition of GRMs (or its alternative that generates fewer top singular values using genotype matrices) is a necessary step for many analyses including estimation of SNP-heritability, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and genomic prediction. However, the GRMs and genotype matrices provided by modern biobanks are too large to be stored in active memory. To accommodate the current and future ìbigger-dataî, we develop a disk-based tool, Out-of-Core Matrices Analyzer (OCMA), using state-of-the-art computational techniques that can nimbly perform eigen and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analyses. By integrating memory mapping (mmap) and the latest matrix factorization libraries, our tool is fast and memory-efficient. To demonstrate the impressive performance of OCMA, we test it on a personal computer. For full eigen-decomposition, it solves an ordinary GRM (N = 10,000) in 55 sec. For SVD, a commonly used faster alternative of full eigen-decomposition in genomic analyses, OCMA solves the top 200 singular values (SVs) in half an hour, top 2,000 SVs in 0.95 hr, and all 5,000 SVs in 1.77 hr based on a very large genotype matrix (N = 1,000,000, M = 5,000) on the same personal computer. OCMA also supports multi-threading when running in a desktop or HPC cluster. Our OCMA tool can thus alleviate the computing bottleneck of classical analyses on large genomic matrices, and make it possible to scale up current and emerging analytical methods to big genomics data using lightweight computing resources."

To that end, we report here the determination of reference sequences for six additional relatives of Juglans regia: Juglans sigillata (also from section Dioscaryon), Juglans nigra, Juglans microcarpa, Juglans hindsii (from section Rhysocaryon), Juglans cathayensis (from section Cardiocaryon), and the closely related Pterocarya stenoptera. While these are ëdraftí genomes, ranging in size between 640Mbp and 990Mbp, their contiguities and accuracies can support powerful annotations of genomic variation that are often the foundation of new avenues of research and breeding. We annotated nucleotide divergence and synteny by creating complete pairwise alignments of each reference genome to the remaining six. In addition, we have re-sequenced a sample of accessions from four Juglans species (including regia). The variation discovered in these surveys comprises a critical resource for experimentation and breeding, as well as a solid complementary annotation. To demonstrate the potential of these resources the structural and sequence variation in and around the polyphenol oxidase loci, PPO1 and PPO2 were investigated. As reported for other seed crops variation in this gene is implicated in the domestication of walnuts. The apparently Juglandaceae specific PPO1 duplicate shows accelerated divergence and an excess of amino acid replacement on the lineage leading to accessions of the domesticated nut crop species, Juglans regia and sigillata."

The circular bacterial replicons are projected as horizontal lines with fixed length of 360, representing the degrees of a circle. A coordinate system is created with length of the replicon along the x-axis and the number of replicon used on the y-axis. When a query sequence matches with a gene/protein of a particular replicon, the BLAST-results are depicted as an ìx,yî position in a specially adapted plot. This tool allows the visualization of the results from the whole data to a particular gene/protein in real time with low computational resources."

I describe a fast and memory-efficient implementation of an on-line sampling method developed for tape drives 30 years ago. Focusing on genotype files, I test the performance of this technique on modern solid-state and spinning hard drives, and show that it performs well compared to a simple sampling scheme. I illustrate its utility by developing a method to quickly estimate genome-wide patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay with distance. I provide open-source software that samples loci from several variant format files, a separate program that performs LD decay estimates, and a C++ library that lets developers incorporate these methods into their own projects."

To conduct meta-analysis of QTL requires projecting them onto a common genomic framework, either a consensus genetic map or genomic sequence. The latter strategy is pursued here. Of 774 QTL mapped in wheat and wheat relatives found in the literature, 585 (75.6%) were successfully projected onto the Aegilops tauschii pseudomolecules. QTL mapped with SNP markers were more successfully projected (92.2%) than those mapped with SSR markers (66.2%). The QTL were not distributed homogeneously along chromosome arms. Their frequencies increased in the proximal-to-distal direction but declined in the most distal regions and were weakly correlated with recombination rates along the chromosome arms. Databases for projected SSR markers and QTL were constructed and incorporated into the Ae. tauschii JBrowse. To facilitate meta-QTL analysis, eight clusters of QTL were used to estimate standard deviations () of independently mapped QTL projected onto the Ae. tauschii genome sequence. The standard deviations  were modeled as an exponential decay function of recombination rates along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes. We implemented four hypothesis tests for determining the membership of query QTL. The hypothesis tests and estimation procedure for  were implemented in a web portal for meta-analysis of projected QTL. Twenty-one QTL for Fusarium head blight resistance mapped on wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D were analyzed to illustrate the use of the portal for meta-QTL analyses."

SMIs also serve as lead compounds for drug discovery. However, discovery of selective SMIs is costly and inefficient. The action of SMIs can be modeled simply by tagging gene products with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) that triggers rapid ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the tagged protein upon exposure of live cells to auxin. To determine if this approach is broadly effective, we AID-tagged over 750 essential proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and observed growth inhibition by low concentrations of auxin in over 66% of cases. Polytopic transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum were efficiently depleted if the AID-tag was exposed to cytoplasmic OsTIR1 ubiquitin ligase. The auxin analog 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) was as potent as auxin on AID-tags, but surprisingly NAA was more potent than auxin at inhibiting target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) function. Auxin also synergized with known SMIs when acting on the same essential protein, indicating that AID-tagged strains can be useful for SMI screening. Auxin synergy, resistance mutations, and cellular assays together suggest the essential GMP/GDP-mannose exchanger in the Golgi complex (Vrg4) as the target of a natural cyclic peptide of unknown function (SDZ 90-215). These findings indicate that AID-tagging can efficiently model the action of SMIs before they are discovered and can facilitate SMI discovery."

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes."

However, when all founders are genotyped for a large number of markers, such relationships can be derived for descendants as expected genomic relationships conditional on the observed founder allele frequencies. A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation. Our findings suggest that regulation of insulator function by RNA-binding proteins relies on RNA-mediated interactions."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/749.full.pdf"

Its genome is large (> 10 Gb) and contains over 80% repeated sequences. The successful whole-genome-shotgun assembly of the wild emmer (accession Zavitan) genome sequence (WEW_v1.0) was an important milestone for wheat genomics. In an effort to improve this assembly, an optical map of accession Zavitan was constructed using Bionano Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technology. The map spanned 10.4 Gb. This map and another map produced earlier by us with the Bionanoís Nick Label Repair and Stain (NLRS) technology were used to improve the current wild emmer assembly. The WEW_v1.0 assembly consisted of 151,912 scaffolds. Of them, 3,102 could be confidently aligned on the optical maps. Forty-seven were chimeric. They were disjoined and new scaffolds were assembled with the aid of the optical maps. The total number of scaffolds was reduced from 151,912 to 149,252 and N50 increased from 6.96 Mb to 72.63 Mb. Of the 149,252 scaffolds, 485 scaffolds, which accounted for 97% of the total genome length, were aligned and oriented on genetic maps, and new WEW_v2.0 pseudomolecules were constructed. The new pseudomolecules included 333 scaffolds (68.51 Mb) which were originally unassigned, 226 scaffolds (554.84 Mb) were placed into new locations, and 332 scaffolds (394.83 Mb) were re-oriented. The improved wild emmer genome assembly is an important resource for understanding genomic modification that occurred by domestication."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/619.full.pdf"

These ground-nesting bees defend their developing offspring against pathogens and predators, and thus exhibit some of the key traits that preceded insect sociality. Alkali bees are also efficient native pollinators of alfalfa seed, which is a crop of major economic value in the United States. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated a high-quality draft genome of 299.6 Mbp for this species. Repetitive content makes up more than one-third of this genome, and previously uncharacterized transposable elements are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA. We predicted 10,847 protein coding genes, and identify 479 of these undergoing positive directional selection with the use of population genetic analysis based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 19 individuals. We found evidence of recent population bottlenecks, but no significant evidence of population structure. We also identify 45 genes enriched for protein translation and folding, transcriptional regulation, and triglyceride metabolism evolving slower in alkali bees compared to other halictid bees.

Defective stress responses are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Phenol derivatives, naturally occurring and synthetic, display beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The phenol derivatives in this study, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol A (BPA), are widely used as food preservatives and industrial chemicals. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their biological activity and correlation with disease development; understanding the molecular basis of phenol action is a key step for addressing issues relevant to human health. This work presents the first comparative genomic analysis of the genetic networks for phenol stress response in an evolutionary context of two divergent yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomic screening of deletion strain libraries of the two yeasts identified genes required for cellular response to phenol stress, which are enriched in human orthologs. Functional analysis of these genes uncovered the major signaling pathways involved.

In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization. We generated a random transposon mutant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 comprising 39,500 unique insertions and identified genes required for growth in culture and on corn roots. A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the INSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5- to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport. INSeq technology proved a successful tool to identify fitness factors in P. aeruginosa PGPR2 for root colonization."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/651.full.pdf"

Bayesian genotype calling can mitigate these issues, but previously has only been implemented in software that requires a reference genome or uses priors that may be inappropriate for the population. Here we present several novel Bayesian algorithms that estimate genotype posterior probabilities, all of which are implemented in a new R package, polyRAD. Appropriate priors can be specified for mapping populations, populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or structured populations, and in each case can be informed by genotypes at linked markers. The polyRAD software imports read depth from several existing pipelines, and outputs continuous or discrete numerical genotypes suitable for analyses such as genome-wide association and genomic prediction."

In inbred populations, pairwise epistasis is present as additive by additive interactions. Testing for epistasis presents a multiple testing problem as the pairwise search space for modest numbers of markers is large. Single markers do not necessarily track functional units of interacting chromatin as well as haplotype based methods do. To harness the power of multiple markers while minimizing the number of tests conducted, we present a low resolution test for epistatic interactions across whole chromosome arms. Epistasis covariance matrices were constructed from the additive covariances of individual chromosome arms. These covariances were subsequently used to estimate an epistatic variance parameter while correcting for background additive and epistatic effects. We find significant epistasis for 2% of the interactions tested for four agronomic traits in a winter wheat breeding population. Interactions across homeologous chromosome arms were identified, but were less abundant than other chromosome arm pair interactions. The homeologous chromosome arm pair 4BL/4DL showed a strong negative relationship between additive and interaction effects that may be indicative of functional redundancy. Several chromosome arms appeared to act as hubs in an interaction network, suggesting that they may contain important regulatory factors. The differential patterns of epistasis across different traits demonstrate that detection of epistatic interactions is robust when correcting for background additive and epistatic effects in the population. The low resolution epistasis mapping method presented here identifies important epistatic interactions with a limited number of statistical tests at the cost of low precision."

These events often occur through hybridization between closely related species, resulting in an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. With the availability of affordable genotyping and a reference genome to locate markers, breeders of allopolyploids now have the opportunity to manipulate subgenomes independently. This also presents a unique opportunity to investigate epistatic interactions between homeologous orthologs across subgenomes. We present a statistical framework for partitioning genetic variance to the subgenomes of an allopolyploid, predicting breeding values for each subgenome, and determining the importance of inter-genomic epistasis. We demonstrate using an allohexaploid wheat breeding population evaluated in Ithaca, NY and an important wheat dataset from CIMMYT previously shown to demonstrate non-additive genetic variance. Subgenome covariance matrices were constructed and used to calculate subgenome interaction covariance matrices for variance component estimation and genomic prediction. We propose a method to extract population structure from all subgenomes at once before covariances are calculated to reduce collinearity between subgenome estimates. Variance parameter estimation was shown to be reliable for additive subgenome effects, but was less reliable for subgenome interaction components. Predictive ability was equivalent to current genomic prediction methods. Including only inter-genomic interactions resulted in the same increase in accuracy as modeling all pairwise marker interactions. Thus, we provide a new tool for breeders of allopolyploid crops to characterize the genetic architecture of existing populations, determine breeding goals, and develop new strategies for selection of additive effects and fixation of inter-genomic epistasis."

However, the structure of this phenomenon is still poorly known. PD for urinary albumin (PDUAlb) and creatinine (PDUCrea) was mapped using curated data from two nearly genetically identical F2 mouse (Mus musculus) cohorts (383 male F2 C57BL/6J◊A/J (97 SNP) and 207 male F2 C57BL/6J◊A/J ApoE knockout mice (144 SNP)) and a related mapping cohort (340 male F2 DBA/2J◊C57BL/6J (83 SNP, 8 microsatellites)). PDUAlb was associated with markers in regions of Chr 1 (5-64 megabases (MB); 141-158 MB), 3 (~113 MB), 8 (37-68 MB), 14 (92-117 MB) and 17 (14-24 MB) with several positions and quantitative architectures in common between the two C57BL/6J◊A/J cohorts, most of which had a negative dominant construction. One locus for PDUCrea was detected on Chr 19 (57 MB) in the C57BL/6J◊A/J ApoE-/- cohort. The large number of negative dominant loci for albuminuria dispersion relative to conventional quantitative trait loci suggests that the development of albuminuria may be largely genetically dynamic and that randomization in this development is detrimental."

Here the development and characterization of four conditional tagged SV markers for Drosophila melanogaster is presented. This characterization includes evaluation of conditionality, specificity for SV localization, and sensitivity of detection in diverse neuron subtypes. These four SV markers are genome-edited variants of the synaptic vesicle-specific protein Rab3.

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation. Our findings suggest that regulation of insulator function by RNA-binding proteins relies on RNA-mediated interactions."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/749.full.pdf"

However, genes and enzymes for terpenoid and coumarin-type phenylpropanoid metabolism have thus far remained uncharacterized in F. assafoetida. Comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of roots, leaves, stems, and flowers was combined with computational annotation to identify candidate genes with probable roles in terpenoid and coumarin biosynthesis.

SMIs also serve as lead compounds for drug discovery. However, discovery of selective SMIs is costly and inefficient. The action of SMIs can be modeled simply by tagging gene products with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) that triggers rapid ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the tagged protein upon exposure of live cells to auxin. To determine if this approach is broadly effective, we AID-tagged over 750 essential proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and observed growth inhibition by low concentrations of auxin in over 66% of cases. Polytopic transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum were efficiently depleted if the AID-tag was exposed to cytoplasmic OsTIR1 ubiquitin ligase. The auxin analog 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) was as potent as auxin on AID-tags, but surprisingly NAA was more potent than auxin at inhibiting target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) function. Auxin also synergized with known SMIs when acting on the same essential protein, indicating that AID-tagged strains can be useful for SMI screening. Auxin synergy, resistance mutations, and cellular assays together suggest the essential GMP/GDP-mannose exchanger in the Golgi complex (Vrg4) as the target of a natural cyclic peptide of unknown function (SDZ 90-215). These findings indicate that AID-tagging can efficiently model the action of SMIs before they are discovered and can facilitate SMI discovery."

To conduct meta-analysis of QTL requires projecting them onto a common genomic framework, either a consensus genetic map or genomic sequence. The latter strategy is pursued here. Of 774 QTL mapped in wheat and wheat relatives found in the literature, 585 (75.6%) were successfully projected onto the Aegilops tauschii pseudomolecules. QTL mapped with SNP markers were more successfully projected (92.2%) than those mapped with SSR markers (66.2%). The QTL were not distributed homogeneously along chromosome arms. Their frequencies increased in the proximal-to-distal direction but declined in the most distal regions and were weakly correlated with recombination rates along the chromosome arms. Databases for projected SSR markers and QTL were constructed and incorporated into the Ae. tauschii JBrowse. To facilitate meta-QTL analysis, eight clusters of QTL were used to estimate standard deviations () of independently mapped QTL projected onto the Ae. tauschii genome sequence. The standard deviations  were modeled as an exponential decay function of recombination rates along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes. We implemented four hypothesis tests for determining the membership of query QTL. The hypothesis tests and estimation procedure for  were implemented in a web portal for meta-analysis of projected QTL. Twenty-one QTL for Fusarium head blight resistance mapped on wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D were analyzed to illustrate the use of the portal for meta-QTL analyses."

The popular SPAdes assembler makes it simple to generate a de novo genome assembly for any yeast species. However, whereas making genome assemblies has become routine, understanding what they contain is still challenging. Here, we show how graphing the information that SPAdes provides about the length and coverage of each scaffold can be used to investigate the nature of an assembly, and to diagnose possible problems. Scaffolds derived from mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal DNA, and yeast plasmids can be identified by their high coverage. Contaminating data, such as cross-contamination from other samples in a multiplex sequencing run, can be identified by its low coverage. Scaffolds derived from the bacteriophage PhiX174 and Lambda DNAs that are frequently used as molecular standards in Illumina protocols can also be detected. Assemblies of yeast genomes with high heterozygosity, such as interspecies hybrids, often contain two types of scaffold: regions of the genome where the two alleles assembled into two separate scaffolds and each has a coverage level C, and regions where the two alleles co-assembled (collapsed) into a single scaffold that has a coverage level 2C. Visualizing the data with Coverage-vs.-Length (CVL) plots, which can be done using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, provides a simple method to understand the structure of a genome assembly and detect aberrant scaffolds or contigs. We provide a Python script that allows assemblies to be filtered to remove contaminants identified in CVL plots."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/879.full.pdf"

However, when all founders are genotyped for a large number of markers, such relationships can be derived for descendants as expected genomic relationships conditional on the observed founder allele frequencies. A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes."

Although mule deer meet many ideal conditions for a molecular ecological research species, such as high abundance, ecological importance, and broad dispersal and gene flow, conservation genetic studies have been limited by a relative lack of existing genomic resources and inherent difficulties caused by introgression with white-tailed deer. Many molecular tools currently available for the study of cervids were designed using reference assemblies of divergent model species, specifically cattle (Bos taurus). Bovidae and Cervidae diverged approximately 28 million years ago, therefore, we sought to ameliorate the available resources by contributing the first mule deer whole genome sequence draft assembly with an average genome-wide read depth of 25X, using the white-tailed genome assembly (Ovir.te_1.0) as a reference. Comparing the two assemblies, we identified ~33 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion variants. We then verified fixed SNP differences between the two species and developed a 40-loci SNP assay capable of identifying pure mule deer, white-tailed deer, and interspecific hybrids. Assignment capacity of the panel, which was tested on simulated datasets, is reliable up to and including the third backcross hybrid generation. Identification of post-F1 hybrids will be necessary for hybrid zone population studies going forward, and the new mule deer assembly will be a valuable resource for genetic and comparative genomics studies."

These runs of homozygosity (ROH) can contribute to inbreeding depression if they contain deleterious variants that are fully or partially recessive. Several lines of evidence have been used to show that long (> 5 megabase) ROH are disproportionately likely to harbor deleterious variation, but the extent to which long vs. short tracts contribute to autozygosity at loci known to be deleterious and recessive has not been studied. In domestic dogs, nearly 200 mutations are known to cause recessive diseases, most of which can be efficiently assayed using SNP arrays. By examining genome-wide data from over 200,000 markers, including 150 recessive disease variants, we built high-resolution ROH density maps for nearly 2,500 dogs, recording ROH down to 500 kilobases. We observed over 678 homozygous deleterious recessive genotypes in the panel across 29 loci, 90% of which overlapped with ROH inferred by GERMLINE. Although most of these genotypes were contained in ROH over 5 Mb in length, 14% were contained in short (0.5 - 2.5 megabase) tracts, a significant enrichment compared to the genetic background, suggesting that even short tracts are useful for computing inbreeding metrics like the coefficient of inbreeding estimated from ROH (FROH). In our dataset, FROH differed significantly both within and among dog breeds. All breeds harbored some regions of reduced genetic diversity due to drift or selective sweeps, but the degree of inbreeding and the proportion of inbreeding caused by short vs. long tracts differed between breeds, reflecting their different population histories. Although only available for a few species, large genome-wide datasets including recessive disease variants hold particular promise not only for disentangling the genetic architecture of inbreeding depression, but also evaluating and improving upon current approaches for detecting ROH."

However, still lacking are better statistical models for ordinal phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the selection of candidate genotypes. For this reason, in this paper we explore the genomic based prediction performance of two popular machine learning methods: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) methods vs. the Bayesian threshold genomic best linear unbiased prediction (TGBLUP) model. We used the percentage of cases correctly classified (PCCC) as a metric to measure the prediction performance, and seven real data sets to evaluate the prediction accuracy, and found that the best predictions (in four out of the seven data sets) in terms of PCCC occurred under the TGLBUP model, while the worst occurred under the SVM method. Also, in general we found no statistical differences between using 1, 2 and 3 layers under the MLP models, which means that many times the conventional neuronal network model with only one layer is enough. However, although even that the TGBLUP model was better, we found that the predictions of MLP and SVM were very competitive with the advantage that the SVM was the most efficient in terms of the computational time required."

Defective stress responses are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Phenol derivatives, naturally occurring and synthetic, display beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The phenol derivatives in this study, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol A (BPA), are widely used as food preservatives and industrial chemicals. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their biological activity and correlation with disease development; understanding the molecular basis of phenol action is a key step for addressing issues relevant to human health. This work presents the first comparative genomic analysis of the genetic networks for phenol stress response in an evolutionary context of two divergent yeasts, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomic screening of deletion strain libraries of the two yeasts identified genes required for cellular response to phenol stress, which are enriched in human orthologs. Functional analysis of these genes uncovered the major signaling pathways involved. The results provide a global view of the biological events constituting the defense process, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, phenol detoxification by V-ATPases, reactive oxygen species alleviation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress relief through ergosterol and the unfolded protein response, revealing novel roles for these cellular pathways."

In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization.

A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the INSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5- to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport.

These events often occur through hybridization between closely related species, resulting in an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. With the availability of affordable genotyping and a reference genome to locate markers, breeders of allopolyploids now have the opportunity to manipulate subgenomes independently. This also presents a unique opportunity to investigate epistatic interactions between homeologous orthologs across subgenomes. We present a statistical framework for partitioning genetic variance to the subgenomes of an allopolyploid, predicting breeding values for each subgenome, and determining the importance of inter-genomic epistasis. We demonstrate using an allohexaploid wheat breeding population evaluated in Ithaca, NY and an important wheat dataset from CIMMYT previously shown to demonstrate non-additive genetic variance. Subgenome covariance matrices were constructed and used to calculate subgenome interaction covariance matrices for variance component estimation and genomic prediction. We propose a method to extract population structure from all subgenomes at once before covariances are calculated to reduce collinearity between subgenome estimates. Variance parameter estimation was shown to be reliable for additive subgenome effects, but was less reliable for subgenome interaction components. Predictive ability was equivalent to current genomic prediction methods. Including only inter-genomic interactions resulted in the same increase in accuracy as modeling all pairwise marker interactions. Thus, we provide a new tool for breeders of allopolyploid crops to characterize the genetic architecture of existing populations, determine breeding goals, and develop new strategies for selection of additive effects and fixation of inter-genomic epistasis."

A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome.

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation.

In inbred populations, pairwise epistasis is present as additive by additive interactions. Testing for epistasis presents a multiple testing problem as the pairwise search space for modest numbers of markers is large. Single markers do not necessarily track functional units of interacting chromatin as well as haplotype based methods do. To harness the power of multiple markers while minimizing the number of tests conducted, we present a low resolution test for epistatic interactions across whole chromosome arms. Epistasis covariance matrices were constructed from the additive covariances of individual chromosome arms. These covariances were subsequently used to estimate an epistatic variance parameter while correcting for background additive and epistatic effects. We find significant epistasis for 2% of the interactions tested for four agronomic traits in a winter wheat breeding population. Interactions across homeologous chromosome arms were identified, but were less abundant than other chromosome arm pair interactions. The homeologous chromosome arm pair 4BL/4DL showed a strong negative relationship between additive and interaction effects that may be indicative of functional redundancy. Several chromosome arms appeared to act as hubs in an interaction network, suggesting that they may contain important regulatory factors. The differential patterns of epistasis across different traits demonstrate that detection of epistatic interactions is robust when correcting for background additive and epistatic effects in the population. The low resolution epistasis mapping method presented here identifies important epistatic interactions with a limited number of statistical tests at the cost of low precision."

A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets).

The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so.

Knowledge of the location of SVs within a neuron can thus provide valuable clues about the location of neurotransmitter release within a neuron and the downstream neurons to which a given neuron is connected, important information for understanding how neural circuits generate behavior. Here the development and characterization of four conditional tagged SV markers for Drosophila melanogaster is presented. This characterization includes evaluation of conditionality, specificity for SV localization, and sensitivity of detection in diverse neuron subtypes. These four SV markers are genome-edited variants of the synaptic vesicle-specific protein Rab3. They depend on either the B2 or FLP recombinases for conditionality, and incorporate GFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, or FLAG or HA epitope tags, for detection."

Other poorly characterized protein based antiviral mechanisms also contribute to the control of viral replication in insects. In addition, it remains unclear whether tissue specific factors contribute to RNA and protein-based antiviral immunity mechanisms. In vivo screens to identify such factors are challenging and time consuming. In addition, the scored phenotype is usually limited to survival and/or viral load. Transgenic viral replicons are valuable tools to overcome these limitations and screen for novel antiviral factors. Here we describe transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines encoding a Flock House Virus-derived replicon (FHV<U+2206>B2eGFP), expressing GFP as a reporter of viral replication. This replicon is efficiently controlled by the siRNA pathway in most somatic tissues, with GFP fluorescence providing a reliable marker for the activity of antiviral RNAi. Interestingly, in follicular somatic cells (FSC) of ovaries, this replicon is still partially repressed in an siRNA independent manner. We did not detect replicon derived Piwi-interacting RNAs in FSCs and identified 31 differentially expressed genes between restrictive and permissive FSCs. Altogether, our results uncovered a yet unidentified RNAi-independent mechanism controlling FHV replication in FSCs of ovaries and validate the FHV<U+2206>B2eGFP replicon as a tool to screen for novel tissue specific antiviral mechanisms."

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation.

Knowledge of the location of SVs within a neuron can thus provide valuable clues about the location of neurotransmitter release within a neuron and the downstream neurons to which a given neuron is connected, important information for understanding how neural circuits generate behavior. Here the development and characterization of four conditional tagged SV markers for Drosophila melanogaster is presented. This characterization includes evaluation of conditionality, specificity for SV localization, and sensitivity of detection in diverse neuron subtypes. These four SV markers are genome-edited variants of the synaptic vesicle-specific protein Rab3.

However, when all founders are genotyped for a large number of markers, such relationships can be derived for descendants as expected genomic relationships conditional on the observed founder allele frequencies. A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

SMIs also serve as lead compounds for drug discovery. However, discovery of selective SMIs is costly and inefficient. The action of SMIs can be modeled simply by tagging gene products with an auxin-inducible degron (AID) that triggers rapid ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the tagged protein upon exposure of live cells to auxin. To determine if this approach is broadly effective, we AID-tagged over 750 essential proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and observed growth inhibition by low concentrations of auxin in over 66% of cases. Polytopic transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and endoplasmic reticulum were efficiently depleted if the AID-tag was exposed to cytoplasmic OsTIR1 ubiquitin ligase. The auxin analog 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) was as potent as auxin on AID-tags, but surprisingly NAA was more potent than auxin at inhibiting target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) function. Auxin also synergized with known SMIs when acting on the same essential protein, indicating that AID-tagged strains can be useful for SMI screening. Auxin synergy, resistance mutations, and cellular assays together suggest the essential GMP/GDP-mannose exchanger in the Golgi complex (Vrg4) as the target of a natural cyclic peptide of unknown function (SDZ 90-215). These findings indicate that AID-tagging can efficiently model the action of SMIs before they are discovered and can facilitate SMI discovery."

A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation.

The popular SPAdes assembler makes it simple to generate a de novo genome assembly for any yeast species. However, whereas making genome assemblies has become routine, understanding what they contain is still challenging. Here, we show how graphing the information that SPAdes provides about the length and coverage of each scaffold can be used to investigate the nature of an assembly, and to diagnose possible problems. Scaffolds derived from mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal DNA, and yeast plasmids can be identified by their high coverage. Contaminating data, such as cross-contamination from other samples in a multiplex sequencing run, can be identified by its low coverage. Scaffolds derived from the bacteriophage PhiX174 and Lambda DNAs that are frequently used as molecular standards in Illumina protocols can also be detected. Assemblies of yeast genomes with high heterozygosity, such as interspecies hybrids, often contain two types of scaffold: regions of the genome where the two alleles assembled into two separate scaffolds and each has a coverage level C, and regions where the two alleles co-assembled (collapsed) into a single scaffold that has a coverage level 2C. Visualizing the data with Coverage-vs.-Length (CVL) plots, which can be done using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, provides a simple method to understand the structure of a genome assembly and detect aberrant scaffolds or contigs. We provide a Python script that allows assemblies to be filtered to remove contaminants identified in CVL plots."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/879.full.pdf"

However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation.

The popular SPAdes assembler makes it simple to generate a de novo genome assembly for any yeast species. However, whereas making genome assemblies has become routine, understanding what they contain is still challenging. Here, we show how graphing the information that SPAdes provides about the length and coverage of each scaffold can be used to investigate the nature of an assembly, and to diagnose possible problems. Scaffolds derived from mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal DNA, and yeast plasmids can be identified by their high coverage. Contaminating data, such as cross-contamination from other samples in a multiplex sequencing run, can be identified by its low coverage. Scaffolds derived from the bacteriophage PhiX174 and Lambda DNAs that are frequently used as molecular standards in Illumina protocols can also be detected. Assemblies of yeast genomes with high heterozygosity, such as interspecies hybrids, often contain two types of scaffold: regions of the genome where the two alleles assembled into two separate scaffolds and each has a coverage level C, and regions where the two alleles co-assembled (collapsed) into a single scaffold that has a coverage level 2C. Visualizing the data with Coverage-vs.-Length (CVL) plots, which can be done using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, provides a simple method to understand the structure of a genome assembly and detect aberrant scaffolds or contigs. We provide a Python script that allows assemblies to be filtered to remove contaminants identified in CVL plots."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/879.full.pdf"

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes."

Although mule deer meet many ideal conditions for a molecular ecological research species, such as high abundance, ecological importance, and broad dispersal and gene flow, conservation genetic studies have been limited by a relative lack of existing genomic resources and inherent difficulties caused by introgression with white-tailed deer. Many molecular tools currently available for the study of cervids were designed using reference assemblies of divergent model species, specifically cattle (Bos taurus). Bovidae and Cervidae diverged approximately 28 million years ago, therefore, we sought to ameliorate the available resources by contributing the first mule deer whole genome sequence draft assembly with an average genome-wide read depth of 25X, using the white-tailed genome assembly (Ovir.te_1.0) as a reference. Comparing the two assemblies, we identified ~33 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion variants. We then verified fixed SNP differences between the two species and developed a 40-loci SNP assay capable of identifying pure mule deer, white-tailed deer, and interspecific hybrids. Assignment capacity of the panel, which was tested on simulated datasets, is reliable up to and including the third backcross hybrid generation.

Although mule deer meet many ideal conditions for a molecular ecological research species, such as high abundance, ecological importance, and broad dispersal and gene flow, conservation genetic studies have been limited by a relative lack of existing genomic resources and inherent difficulties caused by introgression with white-tailed deer. Many molecular tools currently available for the study of cervids were designed using reference assemblies of divergent model species, specifically cattle (Bos taurus). Bovidae and Cervidae diverged approximately 28 million years ago, therefore, we sought to ameliorate the available resources by contributing the first mule deer whole genome sequence draft assembly with an average genome-wide read depth of 25X, using the white-tailed genome assembly (Ovir.te_1.0) as a reference. Comparing the two assemblies, we identified ~33 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion variants. We then verified fixed SNP differences between the two species and developed a 40-loci SNP assay capable of identifying pure mule deer, white-tailed deer, and interspecific hybrids. Assignment capacity of the panel, which was tested on simulated datasets, is reliable up to and including the third backcross hybrid generation. Identification of post-F1 hybrids will be necessary for hybrid zone population studies going forward, and the new mule deer assembly will be a valuable resource for genetic and comparative genomics studies."

Mud1 consists of N-terminal and C-terminal RRM domains (RRM1 and RRM2) separated by a linker domain. Synthetic lethal interactions of mud1<U+2206> with deletions of inessential spliceosome components Nam8, Mud2, and Msl1, or missense mutations in the branchpoint-binding protein Msl5 enabled us to dissect genetically the domain requirements for Mud1 function. We find that the biological activities of Mud1 can be complemented by co-expressing separately the RRM1 (aa 1-127) and linker-RRM2 (aa 128-298) modules. Whereas RRM1 and RRM2 (aa 197-298) per se are inactive in all tests of functional complementation, the linker-RRM2 by itself partially complements a subset of synthetic lethal mud1<U+2206> interactions. Linker segment aa 155 to 196 contains a nuclear localization signal rich in basic amino acids that is necessary for RRM2 activity in mud1<U+2206> complementation. Alanine scanning mutagenesis indicates that none of the individual RRM1 amino acid contacts to U1 snRNA in the cryo-EM model of the yeast U1 snRNP is necessary for mud1<U+2206> complementation activity."

The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so.

In contrast, what determines the overall pattern of how cell size is distributed within a population of wild type or mutant cells has received little attention. Knowing how cell size varies around a characteristic pattern could shed light on the processes that generate such a pattern and provide a criterion to identify its genetic basis. Here, we show that cell size values of wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells fit a gamma distribution, in haploid and diploid cells, and under different growth conditions. To identify genes that influence this pattern, we analyzed the cell size distributions of all single-gene deletion strains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that yeast strains which deviate the most from the gamma distribution are enriched for those lacking gene products functioning in gene expression, especially those in transcription or transcription-linked processes. We also show that cell size is increased in mutants carrying altered activity substitutions in Rpo21p/Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Lastly, the size distribution of cells carrying extreme altered activity Pol II substitutions deviated from the expected gamma distribution. Our results are consistent with the idea that genetic defects in widely acting transcription factors or Pol II itself compromise both cell size homeostasis and how the size of individual cells is distributed in a population."

In many organisms, simultaneous inactivation of Kinesin-14s neutralizes Kinesin-5 deficiency. To uncover the molecular network that counteracts Kinesin-5, we have conducted a genetic screening for suppressors that rescue the cut7-22 temperature sensitive mutation, and identified 10 loci. Next generation sequencing analysis reveals that causative mutations are mapped in genes encoding a-, ﬂ-tubulins and the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Mal3/EB1, in addition to the components of the Pkl1/Kinesin-14 complex. Moreover, the deletion of various genes required for microtubule nucleation/polymerization also suppresses the cut7 mutant. Intriguingly, Klp2/Kinesin-14 levels on the spindles are significantly increased in cut7 mutants, whereas these increases are negated by suppressors, which may explain the suppression by these mutations/deletions. Consistent with this notion, mild overproduction of Klp2 in these double mutant cells confers temperature sensitivity. Surprisingly, treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing drug not only suppresses cut7 temperature sensitivity but also rescues the lethality resulting from the deletion of cut7, though a single klp2 deletion per se cannot compensate for the loss of Cut7. We propose that microtubule assembly and/or dynamics antagonize Cut7 functions, and that the orchestration between these two factors is crucial for bipolar spindle assembly."

These runs of homozygosity (ROH) can contribute to inbreeding depression if they contain deleterious variants that are fully or partially recessive. Several lines of evidence have been used to show that long (> 5 megabase) ROH are disproportionately likely to harbor deleterious variation, but the extent to which long vs. short tracts contribute to autozygosity at loci known to be deleterious and recessive has not been studied. In domestic dogs, nearly 200 mutations are known to cause recessive diseases, most of which can be efficiently assayed using SNP arrays. By examining genome-wide data from over 200,000 markers, including 150 recessive disease variants, we built high-resolution ROH density maps for nearly 2,500 dogs, recording ROH down to 500 kilobases. We observed over 678 homozygous deleterious recessive genotypes in the panel across 29 loci, 90% of which overlapped with ROH inferred by GERMLINE. Although most of these genotypes were contained in ROH over 5 Mb in length, 14% were contained in short (0.5 - 2.5 megabase) tracts, a significant enrichment compared to the genetic background, suggesting that even short tracts are useful for computing inbreeding metrics like the coefficient of inbreeding estimated from ROH (FROH). In our dataset, FROH differed significantly both within and among dog breeds. All breeds harbored some regions of reduced genetic diversity due to drift or selective sweeps, but the degree of inbreeding and the proportion of inbreeding caused by short vs. long tracts differed between breeds, reflecting their different population histories. Although only available for a few species, large genome-wide datasets including recessive disease variants hold particular promise not only for disentangling the genetic architecture of inbreeding depression, but also evaluating and improving upon current approaches for detecting ROH."

However, when all founders are genotyped for a large number of markers, such relationships can be derived for descendants as expected genomic relationships conditional on the observed founder allele frequencies. A tabular method was derived in detail for autosomes and the X-chromosome. As a case study, we analyzed litter size and body weights at three different ages in an advanced mouse intercross (29 generations, total pedigree size 19,266) between a line selected for high litter size (FL1) and a highly inbred control line (DUKsi). Approximately 60% of the total genetic variance was due to segregation variance. Estimated heritability values were 0.20 (0.03), 0.34 (0.04), 0.23 (0.03), 0.41 (0.03) and 0.47 (0.02) for litter size, litter weight and body weight at ages of 21, 42 and 63 days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). These values were between 12% and 65% higher than observed in analyses that treated founders as unrelated. Fields of applications include experimental populations (selection experiments or advanced intercross lines) with a limited number of founders, which can be genotyped at a reasonable cost. In principle any number of founder lines can be treated. Additional genotypes from individuals in later generations can be combined into a joint relationship matrix by capitalizing on previously published approaches."

These complexes also harbor enhancer blocking and barrier activities. Increasing evidence suggests that RNA molecules are integral components of insulator complexes. However, how these RNA molecules are involved in insulator function remains unclear. The Drosophila RNA-binding protein Shep associates with the gypsy insulator complex and inhibits insulator activities. By mutating key residues in the RRM domains, we generated a Shep mutant protein incapable of RNA-binding, and this mutant lost the ability to inhibit barrier activity. In addition, we found that one of many wildtype Shep isoforms but not RRM mutant Shep was sufficient to repress enhancer blocking activities. Finally, wildtype Shep rescued synthetic lethality of shep, mod(mdg4) double-mutants and developmental defects of shep mutant neurons, whereas mutant Shep failed to do so. These results indicate that the RNA-binding ability of Shep is essential for its ability to antagonize insulator activities and promote neuronal maturation. Our findings suggest that regulation of insulator function by RNA-binding proteins relies on RNA-mediated interactions."	"NA"	"http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/9/3/749.full.pdf"

In many organisms, simultaneous inactivation of Kinesin-14s neutralizes Kinesin-5 deficiency. To uncover the molecular network that counteracts Kinesin-5, we have conducted a genetic screening for suppressors that rescue the cut7-22 temperature sensitive mutation, and identified 10 loci. Next generation sequencing analysis reveals that causative mutations are mapped in genes encoding a-, ﬂ-tubulins and the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Mal3/EB1, in addition to the components of the Pkl1/Kinesin-14 complex. Moreover, the deletion of various genes required for microtubule nucleation/polymerization also suppresses the cut7 mutant. Intriguingly, Klp2/Kinesin-14 levels on the spindles are significantly increased in cut7 mutants, whereas these increases are negated by suppressors, which may explain the suppression by these mutations/deletions. Consistent with this notion, mild overproduction of Klp2 in these double mutant cells confers temperature sensitivity. Surprisingly, treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing drug not only suppresses cut7 temperature sensitivity but also rescues the lethality resulting from the deletion of cut7, though a single klp2 deletion per se cannot compensate for the loss of Cut7. We propose that microtubule assembly and/or dynamics antagonize Cut7 functions, and that the orchestration between these two factors is crucial for bipolar spindle assembly."
